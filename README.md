# Preposition-Disambiguation
NLP project

This is an attempt of improving the accuracy of an existing state of the art - preposition sense disambiguation project published in the
paper below:

Hovy, Dirk, Stephen Tratz, and Eduard Hovy. 
"What's in a preposition?: dimensions of sense disambiguation for an interesting word class." 
Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Posters. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2010.

A simple example of preposition sense disambiguation:

"John met Bob at the office".

"John met Sally at 9pm"

In the above two sentences, at has two different senses: location and time. Disambiguating in it's sense help's improve parsing accuracies.

Few newly engineered features are incorporated. Look out for the final report where we will summarize our findings.
