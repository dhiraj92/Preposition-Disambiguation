1. INTRODUCTION
==================================================

This is a modified version of the semantically-enriched parsing system described in the EMNLP 2011 paper "A Fast, Accurate, Non-Projective, Semantically-Enriched Parser" by Stephen Tratz and Eduard Hovy. It is based upon the code that was released at http://www.isi.edu/publications/licensed-sw/fanseparser/index.html . There are a variety of changes, including bug fixes as well as other improvements such as changes to reduce the size of the parsing models during training and changes to the parsing feature templates. PropBank-style Semantic Role Labeling subsystem is not currently supported and may not work properly with the current dependency parse tree conventions.
