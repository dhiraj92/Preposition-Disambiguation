==================================================
1. INTRODUCTION
==================================================

	This package contains code for a semantically-enriched parsing system described in an EMNLP 2011 paper by Stephen Tratz and Eduard Hovy. The code has been updated somewhat, so the results produced by this system will not be exactly the same as reported earlier, but should be close. 

	The main component of the system is the dependency parser. There is also code for part-of-speech tagging, preposition sense disambiguation, noun compound interpretation, interpretation of possessives, and PropBank-style semantic role labeling. The parser can parse about 75 sentences per second on my machine (Q6600 Intel processor with 8GB of RAM) (not including time for POS-tagging and semantic annotation).

	NOTE: This is research code and backwards-compatibility may not be maintained in future releases.

2. RELATED PUBLICATIONS
==================================================

	An earlier version of the preposition sense disambiguation system

	An even earlier version of the preposition sense disambiguation system

==================================================
3. GETTING STARTED
==================================================

	In this release, only a single helper script is provided. This script (parse.sh) can be used to 
	POS-tag, parse, and semantically-annotate files containing plain text sentences. Each line should contain exactly one sentence and
	the tokens should be separated by whitespace.

	Sample usage:
	./parse.sh input.txt output.txt 

	If you need something that does less/more than this script, I suggest you see the underlying code (tratz.parse.ParsingScript.java)

==================================================
4. COMPILING THE CODE
==================================================

The code is typically compiled using Apache Ant.
	To download, or for more information, see

==================================================
6. ERRATA for the Tratz & Hovy (2011) EMNLP paper
==================================================
	In feature templates:
		The x should not be bold on the line two rows after 'if rho_-1 == CC' in the supplementary feature templates\
	In head-finding rules:
		For ADVP, FW and onward should all be underlined (left-to-right) and RB|RBR|JJ|JJR should NOT be underlined
	Regarding parser training:
		The paper incorrectly states than an oracle similar to that of Nivre et al. (2010) was used. This is incorrect (but was true for an earlier version).
