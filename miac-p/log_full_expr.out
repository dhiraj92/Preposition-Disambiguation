     [java] 
     [java] He had discussed it often with Helen and both had agreed that such frankness was a necessary act of truth-telling between them .

     [java] If a person intends doing someone harm , it can not be assumed that s/he displays a disdain towards humanity , although it is clearly directed towards the particular intended victim .
     [java] 
     [java] And this vacuum is the perfect breeding ground for the inflation of self-doubt and self-criticism , and increasingly unfounded imaginings about other people 's competence , or about their disdain towards oneself .
     [java] 
     [java] Reading the highbrow press made people somewhat disdainful towards television , but no more enthusiastic about the press .

     [java] 
     [java] We camped about five kilometres north of Leddejekkestugan on the open moors by a stream that thundered towards the distant watershed from Virihaure .
     [java] 
     [java] What brought her to a standstill was the realisation that her bedroom was under the eaves , so that the walls angled sharply towards the ceiling , lending the room a special character .
     [java] 
     [java] Ember angled towards her , dragging at his oxy-bottle as he ran .
     [java] 
     [java] He led me out into the snow and we crossed the island towards the beach .

     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] It was a great wordless whoop that echoed round the Castle , and Ruth saw all the spears swerve towards them .

     [java] The car joined the evening traffic as it swung south-east towards Moscow .

     [java] 
     [java] Abseiling back down I notice that Katie , my wife , is traversing towards our gear at the base of the crag .

     [java] She backed gently towards the door .
     [java] 
     [java] Lord John , as white faced as any of the fashionable women at the ball , backed uncertainly towards his friends who hurried towards the confrontation .
     [java] 
     [java] The hostess broke away from a clique of friends and bustled towards him , arms outstretched .
     [java] 
     [java] Then I saw a barrel glinting and realized two soldiers were creeping towards me .
     [java] 
     [java] The wounded cow , however , dashed frantically towards the jungle along with the other terrified animals of the herd and disappeared with them into the shade .
     [java] 
     [java] James Halden was hastening towards the Bagnigge Wells Road when he heard the cry that a man had fallen in the furnace at Smith 's .
     [java] 
     [java] Doreen hastened towards them , her face contorted with anger as she exclaimed , `` Silas -- I 've been searching everywhere for you .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We 're gon na be late , '' said Jackie , hobbling towards the door .
     [java] 
     [java] Yielding to the impulse , he rose and hurried towards the door .
     [java] 
     [java] The man in the worn-out boots limped towards the door carrying an ancient suitcase .
     [java] 
     [java] Spotting Evelyn , Jackie limped towards her .
     [java] 
     [java] He sent a lad after it to try to catch it and with disgust watched me limp towards him rubbing a bruised thigh .
     [java] 
     [java] His stomach jumped as grey shapes poured from behind the boulders ahead and loped towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] Roger managed to get his feet into the wrong slippers -- always a fifty-fifty chance -- before lumbering towards the bathroom .
     [java] 
     [java] Doc Allsop lumbered towards the door , with Harry 's mother close behind .
     [java] 
     [java] She screamed and was saved when her brother , hearing the noise , lunged towards her bedroom .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he ran back along the bare wooden branch that hung across his cage and turning suddenly , raised his wings in the air and lunged forward towards Creggan again .
     [java] 
     [java] As the sound system blared out Gary Glitter 's `` Do You Wan na be in My Gang '' , he would lunge towards the crowd as he entered the ring at Finsbury Park 's Rainbow .
     [java] 
     [java] Adam lunged towards her , but lost his footing and crashed down again .
     [java] 
     [java] The animal seemed to understand Sir John 's words for it lunged towards him with a strangled growl ; its top lip curled , showing teeth as sharp as a row of daggers .
     [java] 
     [java] Humans were lurching towards him from everywhere .
     [java] 
     [java] But even so , there was not what could be described as an irrevocable Protestant march towards Reformation ; the new activity of 1558 took place in a Scotland which was still largely Catholic .
     [java] 
     [java] He said the influx threatened the march towards peace , putting the whole region on the verge of a new bloody confrontation .
     [java] 
     [java] With Sam and four friends I marched towards our street .
     [java] 
     [java] Purring loudly , Cas padded towards her , tail erect , bright green eyes unblinking .
     [java] 
     [java] A lion padded towards them with shaggy gold mane and blood-stained jaws , came straight up to the car window .
     [java] 
     [java] Then my father slowly raised his rifle and there was the tiger , padding towards us along a narrow game trail , his head moving from side to side .
     [java] 
     [java] Frank stood up and , taking up an indignant posture , he placed one hand on his hip and pranced towards her , saying , `` No alcohol ever crosses my lips , apart from cooking sherry . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He rushed towards the corner building that housed the news and wire-service office , hoping fervently that Richmann would still be there .
     [java] 
     [java] She sprang up and all the children rushed towards their father save the baby , who was not , even for that prize , going to chance losing his throne .
     [java] 
     [java] Ignoring this show of dislike from possible future comrades , he who had mocked sauntered nonchalantly towards the door .
     [java] 
     [java] He locked the door of the smithy behind him , and then sauntered towards his mother-in-law .
     [java] 
     [java] They both waited but said nothing until the circular glow had disappeared behind another cloud , when finally the captain came scurrying towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] The spider was scuttling towards the door .
     [java] 
     [java] As Digby scuttled towards it , he began to consider for the first time just how serious his situation might be .
     [java] 
     [java] Alternatively , the patient might be taught how to turn over onto his side and then onto his back , and shuffle towards the chair on his bottom .
     [java] 
     [java] He shuffled awkwardly towards the door .
     [java] 
     [java] The small , cowled figure shuffled towards him .
     [java] 
     [java] A motor-cyclist slithered towards the car .
     [java] 
     [java] Usually someone sneaking towards an artistic niche does so in a sideways , disguised fashion , and under cover of darkness , like a smuggler .
     [java] 
     [java] She set her teeth , then , half stooping , sprang towards the next stone .
     [java] 
     [java] I jogged , sprinted towards my inanimate friend and when I got there I was so relieved I wanted to cry .
     [java] 
     [java] In either case , the herd bolts and the lions sprint towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] Rarely has so important a constitutional bill staggered towards enactment so inelegantly .
     [java] 
     [java] He staggered slowly towards the Monument and at last sat down opposite Jack 's stepfather with painful slowness .
     [java] 
     [java] Close to collapse , he staggered downhill towards the river , to the drink he had craved since noon .
     [java] 
     [java] Guido stepped towards her , making her jump back .
     [java] 
     [java] It stepped slowly towards Tallis , crouched with much rustling and snapping of sinews and reached a long , tapering twig-finger to touch her hand .
     [java] 
     [java] Harq Obispal and entourage were stomping towards their many-finned ship .
     [java] 
     [java] Gordon notices a tangle of walkers stomping towards us .
     [java] 
     [java] He watched as she strode purposefully towards the de Courmont house , her back straight , head up .
     [java] 
     [java] He strolled towards the BMW .
     [java] 
     [java] He eased his broad shoulders away from it and strolled slowly towards her , a faint , confident smile playing about his lips .
     [java] 
     [java] Robyn turned and saw a tall blond man with a smiling mouth strolling casually towards her .
     [java] 
     [java] Grinning , he stumbled towards the bar .
     [java] 
     [java] She took his arm and with her half-supporting him , they began to stumble towards the edge of the moor .
     [java] 
     [java] Ignoring his advice that she stay still , stay still , she started to stumble towards the place where her assassin had fallen .
     [java] 
     [java] Their rod sends an electrical current into the water which effects the muscles of the fish so that they are forced to swim towards their captors .
     [java] 
     [java] She was almost surprised to see Guido swimming towards her .
     [java] 
     [java] Harvey swam towards the ladder .
     [java] 
     [java] Felicity swam towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] Ace , her back pressed against the wall , tiptoed towards the enemy .
     [java] 
     [java] So while the servants continued to sweep the floor and the stewards circulated the wine , she tiptoed towards him , her slippered feet making no sound .
     [java] 
     [java] Jonadab watched the child who toddled towards him .
     [java] 
     [java] AS Prince William began his second birthday celebrations with a photo call in the gardens of Kensington Palace , he toddled curiously towards a TV crew .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , in the silence , Bigwig lurched to his feet , swayed a moment , tottered a few steps towards Fiver and fell again .
     [java] 
     [java] The other travellers tottered towards him through the throng of birds .
     [java] 
     [java] I shrank back while the fortune teller tottered towards the main street .
     [java] 
     [java] But yes , yes now the Warlords were angling away from one another as they tramped thunderously towards the Marines -- who could certainly see them now through veils of smoke in the darkness riven by the lightning of explosions .
     [java] 
     [java] The silence and emptiness of the scene did not become apparent to her until she turned into the drive of the house and realized there were no other cars parked there , no gaily clad groups tripping towards the garden , no jazz band to summon them nor hired flunkeys to greet them , no pop of champagne corks nor buzz of conversation , no bunting , no balloons , no merriment of any kind .
     [java] 
     [java] He touched a lump of rotting offal and , scooping it up , throwing it at the first assassin now tripping towards him .
     [java] 
     [java] A dog , some kind of uneasy black and white mixture between collie and labrador , trotted happily towards me .
     [java] 
     [java] He waddled towards her , taking short little steps as his trousers trailed on the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] Waves surged around her gargantuan thighs as she waded towards the shore .
     [java] 
     [java] My father assented , and we all continued our walk towards the shops .
     [java] 
     [java] It was n't an amused smile , but it was one that sent her away at a brisk and confident walk towards the house , and with a gratifying sense of being respected and appreciated .
     [java] 
     [java] ( He wanders upstage towards the exit . )
     [java] 
     [java] Officers even stopped one man cycling towards Plymouth carrying the ship 's compass tucked under his arm .
     [java] 
     [java] Nor , as these raiders paddled towards an enemy shore , was there more than a canvas skin on its wooden frame between them and a hostile reception .
     [java] 
     [java] As he pedalled slowly towards the farmhouse , logic told the village constable he was on a fool 's errand .
     [java] 
     [java] Traditionally , you should row towards the swan , but swan-upping can be hard work and many prefer to be towed .
     [java] 
     [java] We never did persuade them , but for six valuable hours we managed to hold them on that course far out into the Flores Sea , until finally they came to their senses , noticed the distant and almost invisible shore , and hurriedly tacked towards it again .
     [java] 
     [java] It sometimes proves worth while to tack towards one side of a course to get more wind .
     [java] 
     [java] He made a perfect landing and taxied towards the hangars where half a dozen men waited in Luftwaffe overalls .
     [java] 
     [java] She broke this news to me gently , casting her clear gaze towards the window in preference to seeing my hurt .
     [java] 
     [java] Rows of simple wooden benches drew her gaze towards the altar , where candles burned beside a tall , plain wooden crucifix .
     [java] 
     [java] I would gaze towards home .
     [java] 
     [java] Peach glanced desperately towards the kitchen window .
     [java] 
     [java] She cast a quick look towards the bar ; praying that Rune would soon return and save her from his mischievous lover .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I have no intention of meeting her , '' Jenna began , but he too stood and looked towards the long windows as a car came speedily to the house .
     [java] 
     [java] The bald-headed man stared placidly towards them as they approached .
     [java] 
     [java] Although predatory by nature , they are not an aggressive species and will remain sociable towards any companions that will not fit into their mouths easily .
     [java] 
     [java] They will be feeling indulgent towards us , because we are not so evidently , so rowdily in love ; yet we should be discreetly indulgent towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] It is true , certainly , that Constantine was tolerant towards Christianity .
     [java] 
     [java] Records show the local constabulary to have been remarkably tolerant towards prostitutes and apparently sensitive to the sexual practices of the poor .
     [java] 
     [java] I think it 's even made us more tolerant towards other people . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Edward , his half-brother , succeeded , aged about 38 years , and he remained as King for twenty-four years , during which time his endeavours towards sainthood earned him the title of The Confessor .
     [java] 
     [java] Kalchu put on his jacket and hurried down the path towards the bridge .
     [java] 
     [java] Then as fast as her legs would carry her , she shambled down the path towards the gate .
     [java] 
     [java] So off we set , full of hope , along the wooded path towards the hides .
     [java] 
     [java] Leading the animal by its reins , she descended the steep path towards the place of tents .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] In the morning , his friendship with the Mason was still as strong and his hatred towards Gabriel just as hot -- but he could not quite recollect the reason .
     [java] 
     [java] Many countries are already proceeding towards democracy .
     [java] 
     [java] As I proceeded towards the doors , I realized M. Dupont was following me .
     [java] 
     [java] She sidled cautiously towards the equipment , and perched on the edge of a deep mahogany box .

     [java] Ivan toppled towards me , creaking like a rusty hinge .
     [java] 
     [java] Swirls of mist floated towards us , embraced the car , floated away .
     [java] 
     [java] Ten minutes later Lou Collins was back in his Company limousine , heading towards London .
     [java] 
     [java] Her mind still racing , she glanced down at the map on the passenger seat and then headed towards the road that would take her to Mountpelier Lodge .
     [java] 
     [java] Without really thinking where she was going , she headed blindly towards her room .
     [java] 
     [java] Rising from his sturdy wooden bench , Bash blew out his candle and made towards his bed .
     [java] 
     [java] Marian knew they had no choice but to make cautiously towards it .
     [java] 
     [java] His head ached as he made towards the observation point above the cottages .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] He had left Swansea without even sending a message and , as empty day ran into empty day , Emily 's anger and resentment towards her cousin continued to grow .
     [java] 
     [java] Instead , he did another trick with the steering-wheel , making her lurch forward again as they turned off the road , between a pair of high wrought-iron gates , and headed up a tree-lined gravel driveway towards a fabulous , sprawling , red-roofed villa .
     [java] 
     [java] It is unfortunate that such considerations may be thrust out of view by continuing public -- and perhaps personal -- revulsion towards the concept of child sexuality .

     [java] 
     [java] Within a few minutes the atmosphere in the bay was normal , and Ace was jetting towards the shuttle 's cabin door .
     [java] 
     [java] As he walked across to the aircraft -- which by then had taxied towards the buildings -- he says he saw a dog jump down from the cockpit , before the pilot .
     [java] 
     [java] He came closer and bent towards my ear .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm not sure I approve of the way you were looking at that visitor , '' he went on , bending towards her and speaking quietly .
     [java] 
     [java] And he bent towards her and extracted a kiss from her reluctant lips the way he might have taken the pit from an apricot .
     [java] 
     [java] He stooped gracefully towards the little man and laughed loud and shyly .
     [java] 
     [java] Vass leaned towards her , elbows propped on the desk .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's a sorry day ; '' then leaning towards her , she said very quietly now , `` I 'm not blaming you , my dear .

     [java] `` Well , my picture 's not going up there , '' she grumbled to herself .
     [java] 
     [java] '' Theyr'e dragging us along way out of our way , '' I grumbled to Mala , indicating her note of the co-ordinates for this new rendezvous .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Ada , '' Aronson would insist to his landlady , `` you know what klug means .
     [java] 
     [java] Rain conceded : `` He insisted to me that she was too loyal to give anything away . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` It 's logical , '' he insisted to Owen when they met .
     [java] 
     [java] At the same time Linkworth mentioned to everyone how he was making money from his little shop .
     [java] 
     [java] I mentioned to Kirk that I had no intention of asking him about that part of the tour .
     [java] 
     [java] Working as a pageboy in a club in St James 's in the 1930s , he mentioned to a member that he was looking for a better-paid job .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I suppose , '' he asked without any real hope , `` she did n't mention to you anything about anonymous letters ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] This evening , Francis preaches to the birds .
     [java] 
     [java] As I write Billy Graham is back in Britain again preaching to crowds of thirty thousand .
     [java] 
     [java] Doc Paisley was the first man I ever heard preach to me directly that I was sinner , that God loved me and that Jesus died for me
     [java] 
     [java] They proposed to my father that he make a list of all our properties in Palestine so that they could buy them .
     [java] 
     [java] But instead of panicking , he proposed to his girlfriend , who sat with him throughout the ordeal .
     [java] 
     [java] The Society proposed to the Lord Chancellor various alternatives for cutting the cost of legal aid , and scrutinised other possible sources of funding .
     [java] 
     [java] He proposed to the Sejm ( the lower house of parliament ) that it amend the Constitution in order for him to step down early from his six-year term .
     [java] 
     [java] AMERICAN senator Teddy Kennedy chose a novel way of proposing to his new wife , Vicky Reggie .
     [java] 
     [java] First , she would find a local solicitor and recount the events to him and , second , both would return to Belfast to obtain advice and help .
     [java] 
     [java] A Bible translator in one of the Andean republics recounted the following story to the author .
     [java] 
     [java] He was cock-a-hoop when he recounted this part of the conversation to Lily .
     [java] 
     [java] My Grandfather must have recounted to his children his own role in some of the exciting events of the Magdala campaign , when a British army set out to rescue their Consul imprisoned by the Emperor Theodore .
     [java] 
     [java] Rosa Levine-Meyer recounted to me how Bukharin met and discussed his plans with members of the German Communist Party in the late summer and autumn of 1928 .
     [java] 
     [java] Beaverbrook reiterated this position to Berle when the two met on 21 July .
     [java] 
     [java] The information will be of great help in preparing my remarks to the conference which will take place in Oxford in April .
     [java] 
     [java] TOM WALKINSHAW set Silverstone on the starting grid towards potential disaster with a chance remark to fellow directors of the British Racing Drivers ' Club .
     [java] 
     [java] I thought of making some smart remark to Jamie about stunting his growth , but all lines to and from my brain seemed to be jammed with urgent messages coming from my guts .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Conmen , defaulters , fraudsters , they would n't have minded , '' Detective Chief Inspector Bob Southwell remarked to Detective Inspector Dave Smart .
     [java] 
     [java] It was only twenty-four hours after Gabriel had left the farm that three men came running to report a disaster to Bathsheba .
     [java] 
     [java] Visitors are being asked to be on their guard against fire and not to use stoves ; to dispose of cigarette ends and matches carefully and immediately report any sign of fire to the fire brigade .
     [java] 
     [java] Disgusting -- I 'll report you to the authorities -- perverts !
     [java] 
     [java] Dad had complained about the threatening telephone call and no action had been taken ; but the man had obviously reported Russell to the police and here they were in force to arrest him .
     [java] 
     [java] The government alleged Dr Siraj knew of a planned coup attempt by military officers and that , although he refused to take part , he failed to report the matter to the security services .
     [java] 
     [java] Then more correspondence and a meeting with some of the people who report to him , to review matters , look at management accounts and discuss staff management .
     [java] 
     [java] But she would not reveal to any of them what the others had prescribed .
     [java] 
     [java] As she revealed to writer Sherwood Anderson , she had made a conscious decision to limit the type of image she believed had been most susceptible to critical misreadings in 1923 :
     [java] 
     [java] President Kennedy said to an astronaut , `` Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` I ca n't believe this food , '' she said to Claudia five minutes later .
     [java] 
     [java] '' Mr Gillman 's ready for you now , '' she said to the older of the women , and helped her gently into the consulting room .
     [java] 
     [java] They were the last words they spoke to each other .
     [java] 
     [java] I spoke to her politely .
     [java] 
     [java] All the children called her `` our Hilda '' , though in fact Desmond and Margaret had not spoken to her more than once or twice in their lives .
     [java] 
     [java] There is implied permission for a person to enter premises and state their business to the occupier .
     [java] 
     [java] I would suggest to this conference and more importantly to this government , that that is no way to lift this country out of the recession and it 's no way for us to run an economy .
     [java] 
     [java] I kept talking to his mother and the girl at the cash-register , but I was so distracted that I did n't know what I was saying .
     [java] 
     [java] She had just stood there , scarcely able to breathe , and aware that only a hair 's breadth of control separated her from a fury that would shake her to her soul .
     [java] 
     [java] This notion shook me to my roots -- I 'd mess up my new safety boots , And what about the donkey jacket ?
     [java] 
     [java] The answer shook Maggie to the core .
     [java] 
     [java] Desire shook her to the very foundations of her being .
     [java] 
     [java] He has a stare that can fill a man with dread -- a quiet , almost contemptuous look which shakes you to your boots .
     [java] 
     [java] Sir Adrian believes that today young people aspiring to industry should seriously think about setting up their own small firms .
     [java] 
     [java] It shows that not all labourers ' cottages were flimsy hovels and that families in this group could aspire to reasonable comfort .
     [java] 
     [java] We can aspire to a higher consciousness .
     [java] 
     [java] `` While not aspiring to any `` leading role '' , we are conscious of our responsibility to co-operate closely with all independent states , '' the declaration said .
     [java] 
     [java] She aspired to a more comprehensive vision .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm allergic to roses .
     [java] 
     [java] The Piaroa are as allergic to a notion of social `` rule '' as to the idea of `` the right of command '' .
     [java] 
     [java] `` She knows I 'm allergic to horses and ca n't fire a gun . ''
     [java] 
     [java] If you are strongly allergic to any foods , you will know what they are , but slight reactions can go unrecognised .
     [java] 
     [java] Hay fever is really an allergy to pollen and the peak time is early June .
     [java] 
     [java] Then I was tested for allergies to the serums and taught how and where to inject myself .
     [java] 
     [java] One study carried out in Canada showed that 20 per cent of cases could be attributed to true IgE-mediated allergy to food .
     [java] 
     [java] The sun is really hot and I am in big trouble ( I have an allergy to sunlight ) .
     [java] 
     [java] On top of this , he has allergies to oats and dust and is a finicky feeder .
     [java] 
     [java] But later she developed an allergy to feathers , and that made it very difficult for her when I wanted to keep birds in the house !
     [java] 
     [java] Allergies to wood dust can develop in staff and consideration should be given to using dust-free sawdust and to the staff wearing masks when handling the dry bedding .
     [java] 
     [java] Grass and clover seeds need fairly warm conditions for germination and are more sensitive to drought or excessive moisture than cereals .
     [java] 
     [java] We must believe in ourselves and not be sensitive to remarks made by others who want to hurt us .
     [java] 
     [java] Mussels can live for several years , but are very sensitive to ammonia and nitrite .
     [java] 
     [java] It has also been reported that diabetics may have increased vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II ( Christlieb , 1976 ; Weidmann et al , 1979 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] What instrumental techniques can not do is evaluate the sensory attributes of an odour , in particular its acceptability , nor can they compete with the human nose as far as sensitivity to most odours is concerned .
     [java] 
     [java] Unlimited industrialism is particularly dangerous , tending `` to create bodies of men and women -- of all classes -- detached from tradition , alienated from religion , and susceptible to mass suggestion '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Babies are very susceptible to such infections , especially in the mouth , where Candida produces a creamy or grey-coloured membrane covering the tongue .
     [java] 
     [java] A diver is reputedly more susceptible to the bends the colder the water is .
     [java] 
     [java] Almost everyone in the North-East has a soft spot for them , of course , but few are as susceptible to Berwick 's charms as 36-year-old Stuart Bell , from Redcar .
     [java] 
     [java] On receiving confirmation of his decision from the commander , the pilot made a turn to the left and lined up the aircraft for an approach to the selected field .
     [java] 
     [java] Then the eagerly awaited plum pudding arrived to the accompaniment of clapping and cheering , and a plume of blue smoke from the brandy flames was like the tail of Halley 's Comet .
     [java] 
     [java] Please note that the guests may arrive late to the hotel .
     [java] 
     [java] Mahmoud came to one of these alleyways and hesitated .
     [java] 
     [java] But what is it like to face Immigration Officers when you come to Britain for the first time , not knowing the language , uncertain about the future ?
     [java] 
     [java] Now I do n't know whether they actually broke the door down in the end , but they did gain entrance to a flat very near us , erm and they had dogs with them that night .
     [java] 
     [java] THE house-builder , Trencherwood , expects to see a gradual return to profitability during 1994 , its chairman , John Norgate , said yesterday .
     [java] 
     [java] Here he is surely right ; only the educated and affluent people in Western societies are attracted by the idea of returning to primitive conditions .
     [java] 
     [java] Ruth and David Daniels were looking forward to returning to their house after a year working abroad .
     [java] 
     [java] Breakfast over , Johnson returned to one of his favourite themes on the trip -- Scotland 's economy .
     [java] 
     [java] OH , SO HAPPY : The Qulis show off Farrah after returning to a massive welcome from neighbours last night
     [java] 
     [java] Warning that there was no single mechanism which would catapult Britain to economic strength , Mr Kinnock said : `` Research and development , transport and communications , science , education and training ; they are the priorities .
     [java] 
     [java] Lucenzo swept over to her , caught her arm and dragged her to the entrance of the ballroom .
     [java] 
     [java] She flung herself to the floor and rolled to safety behind the half-opened door , the Beretta clenched tightly in her gloved hand .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Oh , yer swine , '' breathed the young woman as he flung the handbag to the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] David Gower survives a caught-behind appeal off Mushtaq , provoking substitute Rashid Latif ( centre , in cap ) into a dash down the length of the pitch , where he hurled his cap to the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] She was hardly breathing when , his lips warm and gentle , he pressed a light kiss to her cheek .
     [java] 
     [java] Lou pressed her hands to her eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] The glass ball 's pretty warm now and I press it to my cheek and sort of roll it against my skin .
     [java] 
     [java] Cornelius knelt and pressed an ear to the keyhole of the closed door .
     [java] 
     [java] He groaned , caught her hand in his and pressed his mouth to the palm .
     [java] 
     [java] She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .
     [java] 
     [java] Throws her bouquet to her unmarried friends before she leaves .
     [java] 
     [java] And a businessman in Middlesbrough threw eight thousand pounds to masked raiders who rammed his car .
     [java] 
     [java] Paramount have thrown caution to the wind and employed MICHAEL CIMINO to write and direct a movie entitled Heaven Is A Sometime Thing .
     [java] 
     [java] Foreign objects innocently thrown to dolphins may cause their death , as happens with dolphins in captivity .
     [java] 
     [java] He caught the pliers that she threw to him , and the ball of string , and then went to hold the step-ladder steady while Kitty descended .
     [java] 
     [java] Tzann thrust the sealed orders to one side , on top of a small pile of unopened mail .
     [java] 
     [java] He tossed the plans to one side .
     [java] 
     [java] He took two pears from a bowl and tossed one to Rostov .
     [java] 
     [java] Grabbing her by the arm , he yanked her to her feet .
     [java] 
     [java] FitzAlan reached down and yanked her to her feet .
     [java] 
     [java] He had climbed out of the car and , leaving the driver 's door open , accompanied her to her front door to see her safely inside .
     [java] 
     [java] Gyggle also had some good news for me -- he was to accompany me to London .
     [java] 
     [java] His driver and an assistant were told to leave ; the police would accompany him to the border .
     [java] 
     [java] Miguelito said , `` You wish that I accompany you to your villa ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] He conducted us to a new restaurant , the Hungry Horse , which was pronouncedly `` gay '' , with all the young waiters in tight-fitting cotton trousers of small blue-and-white checks .
     [java] 
     [java] Tobias , with his tail hooked , was ready to conduct her to her room .
     [java] 
     [java] She conducted him upstairs to the first floor .
     [java] 
     [java] In the circumstances , I ca n't expect a warm welcome , Sabine thought wryly , as Ernestine silently accepted her light wrap , then conducted her to the salon where Gaston de Rochefort was waiting .
     [java] 
     [java] Ruth enthused under her breath as the waiter escorted them to a table by the window .
     [java] 
     [java] Anyway , he was to escort us to my sister 's lodgings ''
     [java] 
     [java] I followed to the door and heard the creature 's rebuke by way of reply .
     [java] 
     [java] Lord Aldington is determined to pursue me to the end .
     [java] 
     [java] Teversham and his sergeant closed round Morgan , shepherding him to the waiting Land Rover with meaningless gentle instructions to watch the step , up you go now .
     [java] 
     [java] Jilted Griffin , who faces up to three years in jail , was arrested after tracking Lynn Oddo to a flat in California .
     [java] 
     [java] Her desperation to flee seemed faintly ridiculous now , but she stiffened her failing resolve with the reminder that he had tracked her to Glenshee , giving her no say whatsoever in the matter .
     [java] 
     [java] Sniffer dogs tracked them to Laughterton , Lincs .
     [java] 
     [java] A settler called A.B. Findley tracked five missing horses to the Chesnimnus region , where Wallowa Indians were gathering roots .
     [java] 
     [java] He admitted frequently tracking attractive young women to their homes and watching them from a distance , and disclosed that he had been following this daily ritual for two to three months .
     [java] 
     [java] Give this girl a job and you 'll have thousands tracking to your door .
     [java] 
     [java] Now he has decamped to Hollywood , where his blandly commercial approach and hit track record has won him this prestigious assignment , a high-concept , low-intelligence star vehicle .
     [java] 
     [java] They would have houses or lodgings down the coast , and the families would decamp to Largs or Argyll until the weather broke .
     [java] 
     [java] When a part of the city , such as the South Bronx , was worn out , the better-off people decamped to the suburbs .
     [java] 
     [java] Much energy-intensive industry would then decamp to the third world .
     [java] 
     [java] Two Nationalist members of Parliament recently defected to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom Party .
     [java] 
     [java] A high-ranking Polish military intelligence officer , Colonel Michael Goleniewski , who had been in charge of Polish military intelligence in East Berlin , defected to the CIA in West Berlin .
     [java] 
     [java] The trumpeter defected to the West in the mid-Seventies , and clearly found his musical home in the Hard Bop finishing school which was Art Blakey 's Jazz Messengers .
     [java] 
     [java] His explanation for this defeat in the leadership elections - that some right-wing MPs voted for Michael Foot in order to justify their subsequent defection to the SDP -- looks fanciful to say the least .
     [java] 
     [java] Everywhere else , however , the late 1950s saw filmmakers of every hue turning to comedy as they struggled t to audiences and prevent their defection to television .
     [java] 
     [java] Bestowing his wife and children in the safety of the monastery at Cardena , Rodrigo departed to his exile .
     [java] 
     [java] But only those people who are serious enough about birds to keep daily diaries will have recorded the last dates birds were seen before they departed to their winter quarters .
     [java] 
     [java] The senior recruits have gone out with their visitors , before they return to pack ready for their departure to their trade training in the morning .
     [java] 
     [java] Poor Frederick , it took him two years to get over Alice 's departure to France .
     [java] 
     [java] In that event , a hung parliament is bound to include large numbers of non-Congressmen who will shamelessly desert to Mr Gandhi , to be on the winning side .
     [java] 
     [java] He waved his arms about a fair bit and then disappeared to the back of the shop to be joined by , I presume , his wife for moral support .
     [java] 
     [java] Taff disappeared to the back of his trench , cursing the mosquitoes and muttering a Goodnight , Boyo .
     [java] 
     [java] He sometimes had to disappear to the lavatory several times when they met in a pub or cafe .
     [java] 
     [java] The Kawasaki disappeared to the right up ahead of me and I followed slowly .
     [java] 
     [java] The Corporals then disappeared to the different section bars which were doing business all over the camp .
     [java] 
     [java] Tobie was watching Loppe , who had suddenly disappeared to the shore , and was now coming back rather more slowly .
     [java] 
     [java] To restore his sanity , Green disappeared to a small village in South Wales , giving only a handful of trusted friends a forwarding address .
     [java] 
     [java] After the war , he decided to emigrate to Britain rather than return to his homeland which was under Soviet rule .
     [java] 
     [java] The Greek Foreign Ministry estimated that of the estimated 500,000 Pontians currently in the Soviet Union at least 20 per cent would be likely to emigrate to Greece .
     [java] 
     [java] Under these conditions Hong Kong emigration to Britain has been very small .
     [java] 
     [java] A version of the history of the Welsh emigration to the Chebut Valley is taught in schools throughout Argentina .
     [java] 
     [java] Elizabethan England could be portrayed as a period before emigration to the American colonies began , before the ruptures between a British and American way of life existed .
     [java] 
     [java] The measure also restored citizenship to 175 cultural figures stripped of their citizenship on emigration , and to those who had joined the Russian emigration to Israel .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Large 's escape to the bathroom for `` five minutes '' peace from you lot '' is sabotaged by her children who gang up to disturb her .
     [java] 
     [java] Matters were made worse by the defection of the Harwell scientist Bruno Pontecorvo in September 1950 ; and later by the escape to Moscow of the British diplomatic defectors Burgess and Maclean in June 1951 .
     [java] 
     [java] He yearned for escape to a place and an audience which would appreciate his talents to the full .
     [java] 
     [java] So far as the timing of his escape to Germany was concerned , Joyce had hardly moved too soon .
     [java] 
     [java] The family escaped to Chester and then settled , much impoverished , on their mother 's jointure estates in Yorkshire .
     [java] 
     [java] It was only after their defeat on the Marne and enforced retreat to the River Aisne that the Germans came to appreciate the importance of the Channel ports , ignored in the Schlieffen Plan .
     [java] 
     [java] The herdsman beat a tactful retreat to the end of the cowshed and then I took the opportunity to say what I thought .
     [java] 
     [java] The Brigantes had held it once , against the Romans , but they had retreated to the mountains and left it to gorse and the bracken .
     [java] 
     [java] Seeing her name on none of the placards paraded outside the customs hall , she retreated to the shade of a wall opposite the terminal .
     [java] 
     [java] Edward made himself a cup of tea and vanished to the Britches , where he stayed late into the dusk .
     [java] 
     [java] His half-brother had been called in to act as best man in place of his real brother who had vanished to Spain .
     [java] 
     [java] I withdrew to my cabin , to find that I was just in time for a repeat episode of Garry Garrison , Para-space Pilot .
     [java] 
     [java] Both had remonstrated with the King when he withdrew to his private chambers in the castle to dress for the journey .
     [java] 
     [java] To protect themselves they also determined to withdraw to a monastery .
     [java] 
     [java] He had spent many pleasant evenings here ; and Catherine 's parents had been trusting enough to withdraw to the morning room , leaving them alone together .
     [java] 
     [java] Forster now withdrew to Rothbury , which he reached on 19 October .
     [java] 
     [java] It could have recognised the independence of Bosnia and begun a negotiated withdrawal to Serbia and Montenegro .
     [java] 
     [java] The Company made a 60-mile withdrawal to the beach at Betano and were picked up with Portuguese and Dutch civilians evacuated at the same time , the relief ships being bombed during their approach for this night landing .
     [java] 
     [java] Bruce had in fact been contemplating a withdrawal to the hills rather than risk a head-on clash with forces which so visibly outnumbered his own .
     [java] 
     [java] It was a typical winter 's day on the east coast , with a chill , sleet-laden wind which caused the official party to make a hasty withdrawal to the reception lounge after the launching ceremony .
     [java] 
     [java] This line is to be reopened soon for tourists and again the steam-trains will chug to Aqaba on the coast .
     [java] 
     [java] Thinking that was a dig at female priorities , she smiled but said nothing as they chugged slowly to a small jetty .
     [java] 
     [java] As he yanked one out for himself , something clattered loudly to the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] Luke tightened his grip on her and the pitchfork clattered to the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] The plate clattered to the kitchen table .
     [java] 
     [java] Burning timbers crashed to the ground , to be extinguished in the billowing cloud of dust .
     [java] 
     [java] With little enthusiasm for the day , Fabia got out of bed and , mulling over her problems and the fact that anywhere she went from now on would have to be on foot , she pattered to the bathroom to take a shower .
     [java] 
     [java] As the two girls stood there , Isabel dubiously eyeing the rickety-looking structure at her feet , a wagon rumbled to a stop behind them , filled with women .
     [java] 
     [java] The car screeched to a halt in the middle of the road .
     [java] 
     [java] Traffic screeched to a stop and dozens of people dashed to grab handfuls of notes swirling in the wind .
     [java] 
     [java] Sigarup picked up a piece of unlit jharo and held it in the fire until it was blazing and drips of flaming resin fell from it , spluttering to the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] Where previously they would on occasion lose direction and splutter to a halt , now their relentless barrage seamlessly moves from one epic song to another .
     [java] 
     [java] Some caught in the rigging and thudded to the deck , spitting and baring their fangs at us before being hurriedly kicked overboard .
     [java] 
     [java] And sometimes , when the heaviest boulders thumped to the ground , I could feel the reverberations jolting the house .
     [java] 
     [java] She crossed to the fireplace , and put some more coal on the fire .
     [java] 
     [java] From the summit descend steeply north-west to Bwlch Eryl Farchog .
     [java] 
     [java] Then they descended again to the concourse .
     [java] 
     [java] The road descends to valley level in lovely birch woods and reaches a junction where the old road for Tomdoun and Kinlochhourn turns off .
     [java] 
     [java] The market paused for breath yesterday with the FTSE index dipping seven points to 2346.7 .
     [java] 
     [java] The sea , rather than dipping to the horizon , curled up like the lip of a dish .
     [java] 
     [java] He edged backwards to the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] The wounded bird plummeted to earth like a dive-bomber , its beak piercing G. F. Westerby 's chest and pinning him to the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] The thatched pyramid roofs reached almost to the ground and rose to points twenty feet overhead .
     [java] 
     [java] Quick as she was , Feargal was quicker and swerved swiftly to one side .
     [java] 
     [java] Ashley had swung to a middle-aged woman beside her to demand if she knew when the camera shot changed .
     [java] 
     [java] Before reaching Great End however , follow the main path which veers to the right , down to a broad elevated col called Esk Hause ( 1.25 miles ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Our aircraft leads the way whilst the second weaves to left and right to cover our tail .
     [java] 
     [java] The man ducked , weaving to his left so that Trent 's fist caught him high on the right cheek .
     [java] 
     [java] Leonie sat up straight , tucked her feet to one side , put her hands round her knees .
     [java] 
     [java] After several more paragraphs stating that any Yugoslavs '' who can not be disposed of '' on these conditions should be retained until arrangements can be made for their evacuation to Italy , an additional '' NOTE '' refers back to para ( i ) : '' There was considerable discussion upon the interpretation of the term '' use of force '' .
     [java] 
     [java] A LIFEBOAT crew plucked a young man to safety from the freezing North Sea .
     [java] 
     [java] The permanent staff was gradually purged to other camps until there were none of the original `` old people '' left .
     [java] 
     [java] His restriction of liberty and her impending removal to Portsmouth and the Wrens looked like making their relationship another casualty of war .
     [java] 
     [java] They have a legal duty to investigate such complaints and legal powers , if necessary , to remove a child to a place of safety and apply to a court for a `` care order '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Delia Sutherland , having given Kennedy 's hand a cursory grip , backed to the fireplace , heels on the fender , gaining two inches .
     [java] 
     [java] One of DEC 's principal Alpha RISC architects , Richard Witek , has reportedly bolted to Apple Computer Inc .
     [java] 
     [java] As the frightened boy bolted to Gooseneck 's side , there was a scream from Fishbane 's corner where an unwary Pole had reaped the consequences of turning her back to view the drama .
     [java] 
     [java] Though , since her denial was hardly any excuse for the way she had been trying to bolt to her room , she felt honour-bound to give him just as straightforward an explanation .
     [java] 
     [java] Yesterday evening , just before she 'd bolted to the safety of her bedroom , he really had seemed different , more relaxed , human .
     [java] 
     [java] She bustled to the dresser and tucked -- I saw it -- a small package deep inside the drawer .
     [java] 
     [java] Farrell clambered to his feet , breathing heavily , forced to inhale the reeking smell .
     [java] 
     [java] The third time she clambered stiffly to her feet and looked about her , dazed by the darkness outside the closed circle of torchlight , and switched off the beam to acclimatise once again to the starry night .
     [java] 
     [java] Steve and I had climbed to the end of the Double Corniced Crest , a hateful and difficult section with all the solidity of a haystack on edge , balanced on a skyscraper .
     [java] 
     [java] Lord John slowly climbed to his feet .
     [java] 
     [java] At dawn that day I had climbed to the hilltop beyond Applegarth , and had felt against my skin that indefinable difference that heralds a change of wind .
     [java] 
     [java] My mother parked her bicycle in the shoulder and took my hand , and we climbed to the top of the hill .
     [java] 
     [java] So , still roped from the crevasse fields , we gingerly crawled to the top .
     [java] 
     [java] He still felt sullied by what he 'd had to do -- to crawl to someone like Bernard Walton .
     [java] 
     [java] She crept upstairs to the bathroom , switching off lights as she went .
     [java] 
     [java] Maud crept to the door and opened it very slowly .
     [java] 
     [java] Blowing out the candle , Tilly crept to the kitchen door and gingerly opened it .
     [java] 
     [java] The woman darted to the blackboard and told her : `` Your uncle made that . ''
     [java] 
     [java] After seeing the competitors set off , there was a dash to Forster Square Station to catch the train to Esholt .
     [java] 
     [java] Colonel Neame had hoped to make a quick dash to the peak .
     [java] 
     [java] Within a minute of the resumption , man-of-the-match Iro continued the Leeds recovery with a powerful 40-yard dash to the line and Schofield added the goal .
     [java] 
     [java] Skelton had partnered Florida in the knockout event and just shaded Whitaker and Fonda in a thrilling dash to the finishing line .
     [java] 
     [java] Only a quick dash to the shelter of a stack of tins saved them .
     [java] 
     [java] A dash to the train saw Dettori and several colleagues arrive with seconds to spare before the first race .
     [java] 
     [java] Robyn hastens to her conclusion .
     [java] 
     [java] She then hastened to the dining-room , expecting to find Silas and Matt at the corner table , but there was no sign of either of them .
     [java] 
     [java] Unfortunately , some of our supporters who had hiked to the match appeared not to have a sense of humour .
     [java] 
     [java] Nick , who works in a Mars bar factory , hobbled to the altar and sat on a stool for most of the service .
     [java] 
     [java] She hobbled to her seat and sat down .
     [java] 
     [java] He grabbed the walking stick and hobbled to the side of the pond .
     [java] 
     [java] She hobbled to the window and looked down .
     [java] 
     [java] Jack Price had hurried to the phone and informed Dockhead police station that there was an attempted robbery in progress at the Clark Wharf .
     [java] 
     [java] He hurried to Wreford 's office , who confirmed his worst suspicions and sent him rushing back to the hospital to bring in Holman .
     [java] 
     [java] In Washington he is considered an ineffective legislator and not a nice man ( his latest scrape involved the allegation that he had sexually harassed a Peace Corps worker while on a jaunt to Africa ) .
     [java] 
     [java] On another of our jaunts to Avila and Madrid we admired the Velasquezes and Goyas in the Prado .
     [java] 
     [java] THE heady air of freedom must have gone to the PM 's head on her jaunt to Czechoslovakia and Hungary .
     [java] 
     [java] Having returned from his transatlantic jaunt to Peru , singer Lee Mavers leads THE LA 's on their biggest UK tour yet , to promote their current Go !
     [java] 
     [java] Clubs like the Hacienda in Manchester now transport themselves and the football and music clientele on monthly jaunts to Europe .
     [java] 
     [java] He jogs to Euston so as to save money , then tries to phone Clarion before he 's stopped panting , but there 's no reply beyond the sound that has lodged in his ear .
     [java] 
     [java] He must have jogged to the shops and back , she deduced , keeping her brain detached as she stared at him .
     [java] 
     [java] Leaping to his feet , Angel charged Luke , about to drag him off his horse .
     [java] 
     [java] Burun leapt to his feet and charged out of the door .
     [java] 
     [java] A shriek of rage and chagrin escaped Miss Merchiston 's lips , and she leapt to her feet .
     [java] 
     [java] A string of soldier 's oaths followed , a violent clattering ; the captain leapt to the ground with an agility that belied his wounds .
     [java] 
     [java] The guard did as he was told , then stood back , watching as Tolonen limped slowly across to the corpse .
     [java] 
     [java] The witch limped to the tree and stretched up her hand .
     [java] 
     [java] Warning lights flashed on the suit 's shoulders as it lumbered slowly to the airlock outer door .
     [java] 
     [java] He lurched to his feet .
     [java] 
     [java] Jumping up , I lurched to the phone .
     [java] 
     [java] And he said that we 'd got to have some softening , some change , some relaxation after the intensity of the march to the hut .
     [java] 
     [java] Eddie marched to the door and yanked it open .
     [java] 
     [java] The battalion marched to a village called Colincamps .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Nothing would surprise me , '' Steiner said , stood up and paced to the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] Groaning , Lindsey reached for her robe , padded to the bathroom and stuck her head under the cold shower .
     [java] 
     [java] He rose languidly from behind the desk and padded to the door .
     [java] 
     [java] Barefoot , he padded to her side , kneeling down unbearably close .
     [java] 
     [java] The sterling crisis saw a Government `` gripped by indecision , paralysed by fear and a Prime Minister plodding to disaster '' .
     [java] 
     [java] And only a super display from keeper David James kept the scoreline down as the Gunners romped to their third Anfield win in the last five seasons .
     [java] 
     [java] The Dutch international grabbed four goals to become the Italian League 's top scorer as the leaders romped to a 5-1 victory over Napoli .
     [java] 
     [java] SDLP party chairman Mark Durkan romped home to a first-time victory along with another newcomer , Martin Bradley , son of former SDLP mayor Mary Bradley .
     [java] 
     [java] We immediately rushed to the ladies , washed Jessica carefully in the sink and dried her under the hand dryer .
     [java] 
     [java] After the ceremony the bridal couple rushed to the photographer 's studio to have their portrait taken , before joining their guests who were waiting for the wedding meal .
     [java] 
     [java] `` What do you know best ? '' she asked , slipping her arm round Beth 's slim waist as the two of them sauntered to the door .
     [java] 
     [java] Cleo scampered to the edge of the clearing and looked back .
     [java] 
     [java] Hoomey scooted to his feet , but several interested parties moved in to deal with Jazz before he could make a tactful retreat .
     [java] 
     [java] Fernando drew away from her and Ruth scrambled to her feet , smoothing the creases from her dress .
     [java] 
     [java] In the hushed silence that followed he scrambled to his feet , his face and neck flushing scarlet .
     [java] 
     [java] She thrust the exercise book into a coat pocket and scrambled to the window by which she had entered .
     [java] 
     [java] On the landing she met Mrs Copley , dressing-gowned , scurrying furtively to the bathroom .
     [java] 
     [java] The disdain spilled over and spread to the other commuters scurrying to their cars .
     [java] 
     [java] Moving the garage doors closed again , he scurried to the fence between neighbouring gardens , passed quickly in to the darkness of the trees next door .
     [java] 
     [java] Although a veteran of a dozen movies , to many outside of Spain Banderas is still that dark-browed guy who sent Madonna scurrying to the ladies ' room in last year 's docu-melodrama In Bed With Madonna .
     [java] 
     [java] Overnight the weather became unseasonably balmy for December and many residents of the hotel scurried to the side of the pool .
     [java] 
     [java] He emerged from the shadow of the bush and scuttled to the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] I saw him doing a side shuffle to the main entrance as we all trooped along here .
     [java] 
     [java] Draping a cloak round his crooked figure , he leaned on his cane and shuffled awkwardly to the door .
     [java] 
     [java] As I stepped into my skis and shuffled to the edge of the steep snow slope , I remembered Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , tailed to the edge of a very high cliff by the posse .
     [java] 
     [java] A cloud of steam shot out of the tube , and the man who was in its path skipped nimbly to one side .
     [java] 
     [java] Better still , slink to a seat , knot your handkerchief
     [java] 
     [java] `` It 's overshot the runway , '' shouted Greg as the plane bumped sickeningly across the field and finally slithered to a halt in the long grass on the far perimeters of the airfield .
     [java] 
     [java] From there it was a hard slog to Tokai but , once there , the wine !
     [java] 
     [java] There follows deep , sluggish water , a very serpentine course between high banks , a 2.5 mile slog to Balnaan Bridge where the flow quickens for the last 100 yds to the modern , single , wet arch .
     [java] 
     [java] A few minutes later , Miranda sneaked to Adam 's bedroom .
     [java] 
     [java] Endill and Mould sneaked to the workshop and without any problems pushed the catapult base through the corridors and onto the grass outside .
     [java] 
     [java] He must have practically sprinted to his house , grabbed the bottle and glasses and sprinted back again .
     [java] 
     [java] He counted to three and sprinted to the radio truck .
     [java] 
     [java] The porter staggered drunkenly to his feet .
     [java] 
     [java] He staggered to a halt , peering at the houses .
     [java] 
     [java] She stamped to the window and thrust the old man aside .
     [java] 
     [java] His fingers stole to the buttons of her blouse , loosening their fragile hold on the flimsy cotton .
     [java] 
     [java] Allen stole forward to a point where he had a good view of the Waste .
     [java] 
     [java] It looked as if St Christopher , the patron saint of travellers , had been watching over him and had guided his steps to Longford and Granard .
     [java] 
     [java] Wearily they climbed the steps to the porch .
     [java] 
     [java] With a brief , mocking smile , he turned away and hurried up the steps to the hotel lobby , his back as hostile as a roll of barbed wire .
     [java] 
     [java] Stepping cautiously to the edge , Sheila picked it up .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , as he stepped to one side , a shadow moved into the light .
     [java] 
     [java] Anthea Darnell strode to the main door of the Lodge without a backward glance .
     [java] 
     [java] He strode to the door and then slanted a look at her that was all sardonic speculation .
     [java] 
     [java] Walks vary from a gentle stroll to the neighbouring resort of Thumersbach , from where you can return by boat , through to more challenging rambles using the cable car further up the mountains .
     [java] 
     [java] My father was taking a stroll to the store .
     [java] 
     [java] He strolled to the door , opening it for her , and she glanced at him crossly .
     [java] 
     [java] Their thin black moustaches were glossy with cologne , which wafted sickeningly behind them as they strolled to their offices .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a taste in her mouth , so unpleasant that she stumbled to the bathroom without thinking of the dark , and gargled with cold water .
     [java] 
     [java] Harry stumbled to his seat .
     [java] 
     [java] They swaggered to a classy , confident victory full of irresistible one-touch football that took the Magpies ever closer to Reading 's 1985 record of 13 wins in a row at the start of a season .
     [java] 
     [java] Unable to free himself from the tangle of ropes and floats , Miles swam laboriously across to his daughter .
     [java] 
     [java] Disturbed , Miles swam slowly to the edge of the pool and climbed out of the water .
     [java] 
     [java] Immediately the archer fish has fired , it swims rapidly to the point where its prey will fall into the water , ready to catch and eat it .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Swim to the shore ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] She pulled on the red wool dressing-gown hastily , glad of its warmth as she tiptoed to the bathroom , doing her best not to wake Penry .
     [java] 
     [java] Shutting the door softly behind her , Theda tiptoed to the bed and stood looking down at the still figure in some alarm .
     [java] 
     [java] The floor tiles were cold but she hardly noticed as she tiptoed to the door and looked into the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] She tiptoed to the door , and slipped back out into the corridor , unaware of her German rival .
     [java] 
     [java] I tiptoed to the open door of the music-room , but there something held me back -- an odd childlike feeling of misbehaving after bedtime .
     [java] 
     [java] As he tiptoed to the next flight he was distracted by a dreadful howling sound , worse than Plutarch at her most aggrieved .
     [java] 
     [java] Emmie tiptoed to the far side of the bed and switched on the lamp .
     [java] 
     [java] He tiptoed to the telephone
     [java] 
     [java] Chesarynth tiptoed to the window , curious now as to what lay outside .
     [java] 
     [java] Sometimes , waking very early , she would tiptoe to the narrow window and look out across the harbour , half expecting to see a ship at anchor there , newly arrived from Portugal .
     [java] 
     [java] She got out of bed , slipped on her dressing gown and tiptoed to the window .
     [java] 
     [java] Without putting on the light , she slipped out of bed and tiptoed to the window .
     [java] 
     [java] Together they tottered to the door .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he tottered to the home , polybag empty of crusts .
     [java] 
     [java] The two girls totter to the lavatory door , laughing at the funniest thing they 've seen since Grandma sat on her chihuahua .
     [java] 
     [java] On May 10th , 38 people tottered to the top , took a quick look at the view and scrambled down again .
     [java] 
     [java] The latest news from Baden Baden is that the poor old devil is just about able to totter to the pump house . ''
     [java] 
     [java] We watched from our window as Mick Jagger gave his free concert in Hyde Park , stood on our seats at the Albert Hall for Janis Joplin 's last performance , and traipsed to Avebury and Stonehenge for equinoctial celebrations .
     [java] 
     [java] The pilots and crew had , in some instances , been able to trek overland to safety but the aircraft , valued at many millions , would remain there imprisoned forever .
     [java] 
     [java] His mother trekked North to the St Mary 's Anglican Mission station , where he received his education before going on to study at the Rorke 's Drift Art and Craft Centre in Natal .
     [java] 
     [java] Tell them I ca n't keep trekking to the other end of the building every time ''
     [java] 
     [java] We three males looked at each other , then meekly trooped to the circular dining table laid out near the window .
     [java] 
     [java] When I returned after nipping outside , she trotted to the stairs , eyed me carefully and yapped , but not at all convincingly .
     [java] 
     [java] Thousands of Europe 's tanks and guns are trundling to the scrap heap .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Perhaps it is a habit we share , this business of vaulting to easy conclusions . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I was certain I would catch something in Rock Pool , and my hopes mounted as I waded silently to the perfect casting position .
     [java] 
     [java] Free guided walk to Howtown via Moor Divock organised by Lake District National Park .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'd rather have the good luck tonight , I thought , as I resumed my walk to the clubhouse .
     [java] 
     [java] I would bike to the tea shop in the High Street and see what blends they had .
     [java] 
     [java] He left the family car in the garage and cycled 12 miles to a supermarket to save 50p on groceries .
     [java] 
     [java] The triathlon team from the Royal Welch Fusiliers cycled 600 miles to Calais , swam the Channel and then ran 375 miles from Dover to Cardiff .
     [java] 
     [java] It was dark when he cycled to his piano lesson , and it was dark when he cycled back to the farm again .
     [java] 
     [java] The Director of Swaziland 's Curriculum Research and Development Unit at Manzini must motor miles to Mbabane if he wants to see the Chief Education Officer .
     [java] 
     [java] The only hope was to try and paddle to the bank , then work our way back into the safe waters of the Cherwell by pulling on the branches of the shrubs and trees that overhung the river .
     [java] 
     [java] He told them he wanted to paddle to Norway .
     [java] 
     [java] He seized his bike and pedalled furiously to the scene .
     [java] 
     [java] He punted the few yards to the shore .
     [java] 
     [java] The crews rowed to the beach and our boat arrived first .
     [java] 
     [java] N. Do you skate to the shops ?
     [java] 
     [java] Let the swine skate to Venice for all I care . ''
     [java] 
     [java] At West Kensington Lee wanted to get out on to the roof and sledge to Gloucester Road but Dean , who had assumed the position of expert adviser , said he was n't sure about the tunnels .
     [java] 
     [java] After a very pleasant lunch therefore , I taxied to the very end of the runway , turned into wind and took off .
     [java] 
     [java] When I landed and taxied to the dispersal point an awed group of aircraftsmen crowded around the machine to examine the damage .
     [java] 
     [java] It was Corrary who pointed , and drew their gaze to the dark shadow on the water .
     [java] 
     [java] The note of quiet desperation in her friend 's voice drew Lindsey 's gaze to Jill 's flushed face , causing her own smile to fade .
     [java] 
     [java] He cast a furtive glance to left and to right .
     [java] 
     [java] She glanced apologetically to Madge and her plump face creased into a smile .
     [java] 
     [java] As they passed the silent Salvation Inn , Yanto glanced to the left at the Murchison house .
     [java] 
     [java] Children do not listen to themselves in the way that adults ( sometimes ) do .
     [java] 
     [java] '' He fidgeted and gave a sideways look to his mate `` yer could say as `` e were well .
     [java] 
     [java] The `` Do you remember when ? '' stories can be so important in getting to know the person who has died , in hearing about how he or she appeared to their surviving family and friends .
     [java] 
     [java] He was nursing in silence the options left to him , and so far they did not appear to him totally unpromising .
     [java] 
     [java] Education is being pushed more towards being an instrument of national policy , or so it would appear to an outsider .
     [java] 
     [java] This seems to you exaggerated , melodramatic , in poor taste ?
     [java] 
     [java] THE University of St Andrews has appointed Professor Graham Smith to a professorial chair in the department of art history .
     [java] 
     [java] The Labour leader , Mr Neil Kinnock , has appointed Mr Paul Boateng to his front bench Treasury team , the first black MP to be given a front bench post .
     [java] 
     [java] In October 1961 Macmillan appointed him to the newly invented office of chief secretary to the Treasury , whose unenviable task was to play the role of Scrooge towards popular proposals for public expenditure .
     [java] 
     [java] To his chagrin , Jane was not appointed to any official position during World War I , and had to be content with privately supporting naval recruiting and propaganda .
     [java] 
     [java] On Sept. 23 the Assembly elected Senior Gen. Le Duc Anh to the new post of President .
     [java] 
     [java] If people want to discuss matters of general concern , they must get themselves elected to this Congress .
     [java] 
     [java] The university authorities encouraged this novel development and three students were eventually elected to the county congress .
     [java] 
     [java] Some of the practices of the colonial state were re-introduced , including corporal punishment , and some of those elected to village councils were rejected on the grounds that they had held positions under the previous regime .
     [java] 
     [java] In sharp contrast to most of his contemporaries , Petain seemed unambitious almost to the point of self-extinction ; when offered the post of Commandant to the Rifle School , he refused because it would have meant his promotion over the heads of more senior majors .
     [java] 
     [java] He wrote that it was `` not cruel to animals but , rather , indulgent to men since it absolves them of the suspicion of crime when they eat or kill animals '' .
     [java]

     [java] Because , while she could just about put up with the attitude of Lady Wyndham towards herself , there was no way she was prepared to let the beastly old woman be unkind to the children .
     [java] 
     [java] The guests were never less than courteous to one another , but for all that , a rather tense atmosphere , characterized largely by distrust , seemed to prevail at this stage .
     [java] 
     [java] Raine was kind and courteous to me -- not a bit like her `` wicked-stepmother '' image ''
     [java] 
     [java] When they visit I expect my husband to be polite to them .
     [java] 
     [java] Annabel Hogan was polite to him even if her maid was n't .
     [java] 
     [java] He has been polite to Paul all along .
     [java] 
     [java] She helped the teachers , was kind to the younger girls , respectful to the older ones and friendly to the two daughters of a Rajput textile millionaire who , as the school 's sole representatives of a race other than Anglo-Saxon , were not sought-after companions .
     [java] 
     [java] They were , she realised , respectful to each other and kind , as to valued equals .
     [java] 
     [java] May we use his example to remind us to be caring and compassionate to everyone this Christmas time .
     [java] 
     [java] Be kind and compassionate to one another , forgiving each other , just as in Christ God forgave you .
     [java] 
     [java] Balboa was constructive in his approach to the Isthmus , generally compassionate to the Indians , inventive in his plans for exploration and the furthering of Imperial aims .
     [java] 
     [java] You block and deny my aspirations to creativity and permanence .
     [java] 
     [java] `` If you 're right about Petula , then you 're not being fair to her , are you ?
     [java] 
     [java] I know that I 'm being unfair to you and to Virginia , but what I feel for you -- what I have always felt for you -- has made a weakling of me . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I also feel it would be unfair to my daughter to have an affair with a woman .
     [java] 
     [java] But I have been unfair to the typists .
     [java] 
     [java] The hon. Gentleman is being unfair to the North sea supplies industry .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It would have been terribly unfair to him and any possible new owners to find him a new home when he was in such a terrible state .
     [java] 
     [java] When a system is unjust to the core , abolition , not reform , is what respect for justice demands .
     [java] 
     [java] We can not feel that such an arrangement is in any way unjust to you .
     [java] 
     [java] She was very hospitable , made Jane sit down , was friendly to the dogs , brought coffee , then sat down herself , obviously overjoyed to have found a neighbour .
     [java] 
     [java] The people seemed friendly to him as if he often went there .
     [java] 
     [java] Dr Neil had been kind and friendly to her when she had served him breakfast .
     [java] 
     [java] The report also found that the Church can appear unfriendly to outsiders , and needs to teach more about the basics of the Christian faith .
     [java] 
     [java] Ell was n't unfriendly to Bernice .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Your ancestors were gracious to their servants , Nuadu of the Silver Arm , '' he said , sneeringly .
     [java] 
     [java] I suppose I must at least be civil to the Danish envoys , and offer them some entertainment .
     [java] 
     [java] Mum had been civil to me since the soap episode but something had gone between us .
     [java] 
     [java] The main objective is to find a solution agreeable to the company in terms of its feasibility and cost .
     [java] 
     [java] He made himself agreeable to the earl 's squires in the stableyard , and kept his ears open for any revealing mentions of Robert Bossu 's tastes , temperament and interests , and what he garnered was encouraging .
     [java] 
     [java] If Gina was pleasant to him she could share ; if not , he would make them last for two meals .
     [java] 
     [java] So , be presentable , be articulate and be pleasant to everyone you meet .
     [java] 
     [java] For the remaining half-hour she would be pleasant to him , and then she would quietly and purposefully remind him of the time , and with gentle dignity insist that he take her home .
     [java] 
     [java] If she wanted this job , she would have to be reasonably pleasant to him , however much it stuck in her throat at times .
     [java] 
     [java] Formerly he had been prone to pessimism , full of gloomy prognoses about over-population and wars , which would prevent mankind from ever fulfilling its dream of colonising other planets .
     [java] 
     [java] Elderly people become more prone to falls often because of arthritic joints or dizziness , are vulnerable to pedestrian accidents perhaps due to lessened acuity in sight and hearing and at risk to the hazards of fire .
     [java] 
     [java] Along with the good humour , it is a reminder that Young 's personality , like his music , is prone to abrupt changes of mood and temperament .
     [java] 
     [java] I was a teenager , prone to the daftness that goes with that age group , and knew no better .
     [java] 
     [java] Take the case of a floppy disk drive 's sudden failure to read a disk when previously it had shown no proclivity to such failing .
     [java] 
     [java] Rural areas were now allowed more freedom of choice as to farming methods , and the peasants ' propensity to more individualistic action was encouraged .
     [java] 
     [java] The propensity to hooliganism is inherent in every society .
     [java] 
     [java] No wonder we carry about with us a sense of inescapable loss , a burden of original sin , and a propensity to wild , anguished violence .
     [java] 
     [java] Even the thought of this plan seemed dreadful to Mildred , who could see how such a course of action was fraught with danger , but there really was no alternative if she was to help the frog-magician .
     [java] 
     [java] But can I really maintain that the affliction is `` visible , painful , incurable , distasteful to others '' ?
     [java] 
     [java] This feature of quantum mechanics proved very distasteful to some of the very men who had helped to create the subject .
     [java] 
     [java] She was mean and horrible to her mother , snide , self-righteous and unkind .
     [java] 
     [java] Jenny 's horrible to me .
     [java] 
     [java] Your father was always good to me , and his uncle .
     [java]

     [java] On Sunday morning Rachel awoke to bright autumn sunshine and clear blue skies .
     [java] 
     [java] The next morning the girls woke to the incessant clatter of the mowing arm circling the big meadow .
     [java] 
     [java] They woke to blue skies and glorious sunshine .
     [java] 
     [java] During the night Tallis woke to the sound of wind in branches .
     [java] 
     [java] There were two pictures taped to the side of the fridge : Jesus and Donald Duck .
     [java] 
     [java] A message taped to Solveig 's door had told him where to go .
     [java] 
     [java] A note left taped to the fridge informed Leonora that her sister would be back in time for supper .
     [java] 
     [java] Lissa jumped , shocked to the core , and he scowled at her darkly .
     [java] 
     [java] Participants said the city 's main square was filled to capacity .
     [java] 
     [java] The HF needs to be a strong solution ( 52-55% ) , with the vessel filled to a depth of about 5-6 mm .
     [java] 
     [java] Every driveway to the castle was crowded and many of those on foot climbed the boundary walls of the estate and made their way through the policies .
     [java] 
     [java] Despite extensive inquiries officers have still not traced the owner of a red Sierra-style saloon seen in the driveway to the 82-year-old woman 's Martlesham bungalow at about 2.30 pm on Wednesday February 10 .
     [java] 
     [java] The Welsh Office are proposing the construction of a bypass to Crickhowell , an attractive small town to the east of the Park .
     [java] 
     [java] He had no intention of selling this portrait and in his 1952 will he bequeathed it to Bowler .
     [java] 
     [java] He subsequently bequeathed the results of his research to Cambridge University .
     [java] 
     [java] The funniest contributions are the cartoons but there are numerous `` true '' quotes as well as jokes , such as : Did you hear that Robert Maxwell bequeathed his body to medical science ?
     [java] 
     [java] William Malyverer bequeathed to Our Lady of Walsingham a little ring with a diamond which Richard had given him .
     [java] 
     [java] But the parting has brought some sweet sorrow to her and her landlord .
     [java] 
     [java] Miss Worthington often felt it would have been an unendurable sorrow to her parents if they had lived to witness the extent of the deterioration .
     [java] 
     [java] It is imperative that these claims are dealt with discreetly to avoid any distress to the deceased 's relatives .
     [java] 
     [java] Liszt greatly admired him , and Rubenstein , too , commended Field to his pupils as `` a perfectionist who would practise a passage a thousand times . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I am delighted to commend this booklet to you which I hope will give you a flavour of the variety and interest available to solicitors in local government .
     [java] 
     [java] In his `` Preface '' to Edwin Muir 's Selected Poems , he gives high praise to a poet whose work is very different from his own .
     [java] 
     [java] But then it is all explained in the last paragraph , where Sir Kingsley gives his highest praise to Clive James , for heaven 's sake .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Praise to thee , Lord , '' he muttered , `` for Brother Day .
     [java] 
     [java] When , in 1651 , the Rump ordered guns from a former employee of his , Browne delivered an emotional remonstrance to the House of Commons : the state 's security , he claimed , depended upon a single gun-founder ; his enterprise employed a `` stock '' of $30,000 , had overheads of at least $4,000 per annum , and had to be kept busy .
     [java] 
     [java] The decision was crucial to those Britons who had now resolved to take up arms against Rome if necessary , but for the Druids it was now simply a matter of life or death .
     [java] 
     [java] Railways were crucial to the erection of the new specialized and integrated economic order .
     [java] 
     [java] In no field is this more obvious than in community care of frail elderly people , for the coordination of services , some from different agencies , is pivotal to their well-being .
     [java] 
     [java] Searches , and the other side of the coin , the registrations that occasion them , are pivotal to modern conveyancing .
     [java] 
     [java] I reached down and picked up the empty wine bottle and smashed it to the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] The corpse was barely recognisable , the face battered with extreme savagery , the skull smashed to such an extent that much of the brain was some two feet away .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It 's always amazing to me that you can be a man in charge of 100 or 200 people , then you get your pension book and suddenly you are regarded as deaf and daft .
     [java] 
     [java] she could get a bus to Bath , but how would she get home again ?
     [java] 
     [java] What they do not do is to make the case for charging token sums to a small minority of users .
     [java] 
     [java] Unlike some of its competitors , XVT does not charge a royalty to developers converting their software and then selling it on to their own customers .
     [java] 
     [java] Consequently , the costs of strengthening and extending the probation service could be defrayed by charging a fee to the offending corporation .
     [java] 
     [java] He augmented his meager income by plying for hire as a ferryman , ferrying passengers across to Greenwich , and sometimes he followed a more grisly trade .
     [java] 
     [java] There was an evening to pass before the midnight flight to London and , despite Tucker 's adamancy that Miss Kennedy would n't see her , she taxied to the Big Bamboo on Wulff Road .
     [java] 
     [java] They 're frightened to death .
     [java] 
     [java] After a long fight to beat inflation , the government does not feel sympathetic to these demands .
     [java] 
     [java] But , unsurprisingly , his father was not sympathetic to this idea and Rolle decided to run away .
     [java] 
     [java] The beacons went out , but as the Junkers taxied to its arrival area the pilot used a spotlight , and the spotlight swept over a flock of 109s , widely dispersed .
     [java] 
     [java] But I 'd bought the wrong weedkiller , it was Tumbleweed and I found out later it 's only lethal to tropical fish , apparently I should have bought pathklear which is much stronger .
     [java] 
     [java] Most pesticides are lethal to earthworms on or near the surface , and some can kill in very small concentrations to a great depth .
     [java] 
     [java] He explained about the year off and told her about hitchhiking to Greece to sleep on beaches beneath the Mediterranean sky .
     [java] 
     [java] It is gratifying that the initial residents have built up a very happy family atmosphere , and have expressed their thanks to the Association for providing them with what they now regard as their home .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Now , if you 'll excuse me , I 'll join Adam and Ace to find out just exactly how much damage , thanks to you , he 's suffered ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` I did n't think I was speculating '' she said in a rebuke to the Government 's attitude towards the advertised high-return , low-risk investment offered by Barlow Clowes .
     [java] 
     [java] Any public rebuke to the BBC , still more any action , will need to be based on watertight evidence .
     [java] 
     [java] In that sense , the party 's new visibility is a distinct rebuke to the democratic left .
     [java] 
     [java] But he planted this gaol in the middle of Buckingham as a sort of rebuke to the townspeople .
     [java] 
     [java] He brought the proceedings to a standstill with a stinging rebuke to the nations of the world and an emotional appeal for help to stop `` genocide '' in the besieged town .
     [java] 
     [java] He found that he could pay a compliment to Charles Raven , from whom he was so sadly sundered in spirit , for his book on Religion and Science .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's a great compliment to her .
     [java] 
     [java] But perhaps the most kindly and satisfying compliment to the Cornish was paid by one of the earliest tourists , John Taylor , in 1649
     [java] 
     [java] There is no country better at patriotism than the U.S. and its treatment of the match should be taken as a compliment to European golf .
     [java] 
     [java] He had fled abroad when Mary Tudor succeeded , and had passed the time writing letters of consolation to English Protestants , and , in 1554 , a savage attack on the English government , the Admonition to England .
     [java] 
     [java] He stands adamant , a living reproach to all others in the circle of brethren .
     [java] 
     [java] Paul saw this as a reproach to himself , as if he had not shown enough interest ; perhaps in fact he had not ; his heart had never been in it .
     [java] 
     [java] Anyone is welcome and the topics chosen for speakers are usually of interest to all , employed or not .
     [java] 
     [java] Because such religions are of more interest to the media than are more `` ordinary '' religions , it is quite likely that whenever the tragedy occurs we shall be treated to the headline Cult Member Commits Suicide .
     [java] 
     [java] Each of these aspects of the geology is of interest to current researchers , but the differences have led to differing specialties within and between departments .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Oh , he was very generous to all his friends , but we always seemed to be in the wrong line . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` And he is generous to the point where he would be without money himself to help someone .
     [java] 
     [java] She notes that the Heinz family has been extraordinarily generous to the gallery over the years .
     [java] 
     [java] Naomi 's parents , in grief and regret , had been generous to their grandchildren .
     [java] 
     [java] Aged 18 , she was given 0,000 from the fund to buy her famous Colherne Court flat , where she lived until her engagement to Charles .
     [java] 
     [java] The effects of large fortnightly/monthly water changes can prove deadly to angel and butterfly fish by upsetting their stable environment .
     [java] 
     [java] Or else , which is more probable , the infection is particularly deadly to rabbits .
     [java] 
     [java] Others had talked in delirium or expressed fears to each other .

     [java] 
     [java] Indeed , Percy Lovitch voiced the thought to Rev. Levitt as he strode past the minister and his wife .
     [java] 
     [java] But what if he had voiced his suspicions to Viola ?
     [java] 
     [java] I love the story told to me by a make-up girl who used to work for a well-known London hairdresser .
     [java] 
     [java] Even today , children retain vivid impressions from the stories told to them by their mothers and grandmothers about their own childhoods `` long ago '' .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Your uncle , for his own reasons , confided something to Francis and Francis is dead .

     [java] When she first confided the name of her secret love to a friend she said : `` You 'll never believe it , but it 's David Mellor .
     [java] 
     [java] It is not good for a physician to confide personal details of his life to a patient .
     [java] 
     [java] Unfortunately he could not confide this knowledge to his upper-management team and so he had to allow his upper-management team to think he was losing his grip .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I confided to Alain my ambition to establish a school such as this .
     [java] 
     [java] But she confided to Jean-Claude that this was a concession wrung from her to avoid argument : not something she had initiated , or enjoyed .
     [java] 
     [java] A week later a still very much astonished Rosemary had confided to Leith that she was indeed in love with Travis .

     [java] 
     [java] How can all that knowledge be condensed into a fifty-minute lecture to students who know almost nothing about it ?

     [java] Murphy ( 1978 ) reports a simple study on effectiveness where interpreted information to deaf people was compared with oral lectures to hearing people .
     [java] 
     [java] But one of her proudest moments as an ambassador came when she gave a lecture to 2,000 fellow scientists in Kyoto -- and there was only one woman in the audience .
     [java] 
     [java] On Thursday we gave our first lecture to a wider audience , and were surprised that more than a hundred turned up .
     [java] 
     [java] The biologists and the applied scientists have done this , have offered lectures to school children , mostly in response to requests that have come in to them for specific lectures .
     [java] 
     [java] It should expand to 50-60 by the end of the year .

     [java] 
     [java] But once one got into Teacher Training College one paid no attention to the course .
     [java] 
     [java] The reasons for this are complex , but basically the more efficient one is as a reader , the less one reads individual words as separate bits , or pays attention to their structure .
     [java] 
     [java] She was paying attention to the men 's talk , to the discussion of money , the fall in the price of wool , and the cunning of a certain local landowner 's brutal conditions .
     [java] 
     [java] We can consciously direct our attention to certain things and think about them .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The Federal Reserve needs to be more attentive to the need to avoid tipping this economy into a recession , '' he warns .

     [java] 
     [java] It is quite possible that the parents themselves will have already noted any slow reactions if they are attentive to their child 's development .
     [java] 
     [java] To give her her due , when her husband was in good spirits and attentive to her she tried to match his mood .
     [java] 
     [java] His eyes were hooded , attentive to the slightest nuance of response .

     [java] Loretta frowned to herself , aware that Geoffrey was taking great pleasure in showing off his superior knowledge .
     [java] 
     [java] Shiona frowned to herself .
     [java]

     [java] The litter born to this bitch on 24 July 1975 was the first to be whelped in New Zealand .

     [java] He began to whistle a tune that had been dancing through his head ever since he left the pub :
     [java] 
     [java] Daft bloody Lois 'll have you dancing through hoops , mark my words . ''

     [java] 
     [java] As much as he complains about having to frolic through the cliches of his life , he is quite happy to encourage it .
     [java] 
     [java] Pages and serving women hastened through it , each of them bearing an item of outdoor clothing .

     [java] 
     [java] `` This thought has taken the occasional jaunt through my mind , '' Ed agreed .

     [java] 
     [java] I have not padded through the Taj Mahal ,

     [java] The four of us plod silently through the darkness : Rufus and Des camouflaged in the night , me in my shirt sleeves , Tamsin in that white taffeta frock beneath my jacket .
     [java] 
     [java] What plodded through the front door was not the lovable , lazy hound who had once lived there but a grim-faced light bulb serial killer !

     [java] 
     [java] Tiny tell-tale marks showed where voles and mice had scampered through grass tunnels roofed with snow to reach the safety of their homes .
     [java] 
     [java] And I , where was I , during those years when chipmunks scampered through the undercarriage of the battered little Kobold ?
     [java] 
     [java] He eventually scrambled through the door and onto the top of the sinking tanker .
     [java] 
     [java] When they were still two miles away his headlights caught a half-naked figure trying to scramble through a hedge .
     [java] 
     [java] Bernice scrambled madly through the twisted wreckage as Anushkia Smyslov lost herself in the chaos , shouting orders .
     [java] 
     [java] Beetles of every imaginable hue scurried through the grass , mobile jewels .
     [java] 
     [java] Julia , wearing a black leather jacket and faded jeans , hid her face as she scurried through Heathrow .
     [java] 
     [java] She thought of all the rats scurrying through the streets , hustling for a crust .
     [java] 
     [java] She scuttled through the door and found herself in a long drawing-room choked with old-fashioned furniture .
     [java] 
     [java] They pulled on jeans and jumpers , had a hasty breakfast , tipped their clothes into their cases , then scuttled through the dripping trees to the pea-green Polo .
     [java] 
     [java] A few moments later he was scuttling through the palace 's corridors holding the message capsule and -- owing to carelessness brought on by surprise -- sucking at the nasty beak wound on the back of his hand .
     [java] 
     [java] Johnny Dee winked lewdly , and he and Kelley shuffled backwards through the doorway and were gone .
     [java] 
     [java] She shuffled through the pack again .
     [java] 
     [java] She skipped through the gardens until she found Ben Weatherstaff , who was digging and talking to his robin .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'd naively thought they could mount some low-profile operation to catch Andy watching his own funeral ; I 'd imagined cops slinking through the undergrowth , whispering into radios , gradually closing in .
     [java] 
     [java] McEnroe 's autumn slog through Europe , which will include a trip to Wembley for next month 's Silk Cut Championships , is designed for one purpose : `` I 'm trying to get myself prepared for the Masters , hopefully to do well .
     [java] 
     [java] It takes 10 minutes to reach the arch , slogging through the filth and scum .
     [java] 
     [java] There were many amusing things that happened on the way out , to distract us from the utter boredom of slogging through the Med and down the Red Sea .
     [java] 
     [java] He feels he has done his share of slogging through atrocious weather and will not miss getting up at 4.30am .
     [java] 
     [java] She closed her door quietly , regretting not leaving the Polo on the road , and tried to sneak through the back way to her room .
     [java] 
     [java] Gabriel blushed violently and felt the sweat spring through his palms and trickle down the hilt of his tin sword .
     [java] 
     [java] Perspiration sprang through the skin of her body instantaneously .
     [java] 
     [java] He sprinted through the defence from halfway after a quickly taken penalty , and Aldred 's conversion put Collegians 10-9 ahead .
     [java] 
     [java] I desperately wanted to be out there with the sheep , hiding behind boulders and sprinting through the heather .
     [java] 
     [java] The next thing I saw was Charlie sprinting through the traffic towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] Words drone and a family of flies stagger through the heavy air as if in pursuit of them .
     [java] 
     [java] The fellow swayed on his feet and staggered through the doorway .
     [java] 
     [java] He totters backwards , and staggers through the dark opening into the patch of yard below the railway viaduct .
     [java] 
     [java] He stamped through the restaurant beating the pineapple air with his short muscular arms .
     [java] 
     [java] It was an eerie feeling to be stealing through the forest like this .
     [java] 
     [java] In the end , it was relatively easy to steal through the darkened halls of Tara and out into the night .
     [java] 
     [java] David took Hayley 's hand in his , and Juliet felt a strange warmth steal through her , and a pang of some emotion she did n't recognise .
     [java] 
     [java] Lucien could feel a cloud of sleep stealing through his limbs .
     [java] 
     [java] As the ethereal strains of Ravel stole through the room , Penry let himself down on the sofa , eyes closed .
     [java] 
     [java] The sight of them sent a warmth stealing through her veins , and she was afraid her new dress might soon smell of sweat like the old one .
     [java] 
     [java] They knew only , as they retraced their steps through the deep woodland of the park , that they could no longer be content at Racedown , even had it been possible for them to remain there .
     [java] 
     [java] You can visit the village -- it has a pub , beach and a shop -- then retrace your steps through the woods to reach the Saints ' Way .
     [java] 
     [java] The Sergeant and the Constable had continued on for two steps through the door towards their senior officer without realising that they had left Jimmy behind .
     [java] 
     [java] He began to tremble as he stepped through the door and looked up at the dim stairway which climbed steeply out of the bare and musty hall .
     [java] 
     [java] For a moment it was as though they had stepped through the doorway and into a Mediterranean resort .
     [java] 
     [java] He stepped through the deep snow towards the grave where Tallis stood her silent guard .
     [java] 
     [java] Maggie kept catching her eye with an expression of knowing amusement , but at the same time she obviously hated having these men stomping through her every possession and destroying any remaining magic in her secret chamber .
     [java] 
     [java] He glared at Yanto with genuine dislike as he stomped through the front porch of the pub .
     [java] 
     [java] He opened the gate , walked up the drive and strode confidently through the front door .
     [java] 
     [java] But the giant duo strode imperiously through the mud during the second half to set up Saints ' two match-clinching tries .
     [java] 
     [java] A gentle stroll through the gardens led down to the beautiful long , wide beach .
     [java] 
     [java] Once , as a guest of the Hacketts , he had taken a stroll through the rose garden with Jessica Hackett .
     [java] 
     [java] Tragedy struck as Angela took her usual stroll through a farmer 's field with pekinese Yeng and deerhound Jamie .
     [java] 
     [java] At times , his music has the fragmented feel of a late-night stroll through a busy city centre !
     [java] 
     [java] On a brief stroll through the nearby alleyways we counted 70 bonfires and spirits were rising .
     [java] 
     [java] Jays strutted through a clearing , beak-prodding the ground for green shoots of acorns buried earlier .
     [java] 
     [java] However , they also escaped the severe censure that might have been expected from the high-minded moralists who strutted busily through the Victorian England of his day .
     [java] 
     [java] Peacocks strut through the grounds and the whole is surrounded by an inner and outer moat .
     [java] 
     [java] It is quite common to see an important Orc Boss strutting through the Orc camp followed closely by a tiny Snotling impersonating his walk and copying the Boss ' every movement in an exaggerated comic fashion .
     [java] 
     [java] What did she have to cry about , I thought as I stumbled through the door .
     [java] 
     [java] Two divers swim through a natural arch at one of the reef 's coral heads .
     [java] 
     [java] Then little invisible tadpole things in the pee swam through the bathwater up the woman 's bottom and laid eggs , and six months later she had a baby .
     [java] 
     [java] Is this why the myth swims through our memory ?
     [java] 
     [java] A small , glowing disc swam calmly through the clear morning air trailing sparks .
     [java] 
     [java] Even though I still imagined prehistoric fish swimming through its pergolas , the whole place now seemed almost natural , like a well-planned country club .
     [java] 
     [java] In a fitful sleep I dreamt I was swimming through drowned villages .
     [java] 
     [java] When they are eight weeks old , for example , mouse pups that have been conditioned using mild electric shocks to their feet readily learn to swim through a simple water maze .
     [java] 
     [java] Hitherto , it had been achieved by the male cells swimming through water , a process which demanded that the sexual generation be small and close to the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] I toddled through the gate and made for the tree because it was studded all over with soft dark fruit .
     [java] 
     [java] I toddled through it when I was with Rhine Army .
     [java] 
     [java] She tottered through the open door .
     [java] 
     [java] At that moment Belinda looked over her shoulder and , seeing them together , detached herself from the rest of the group and tramped through the dying bracken towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1878 he tramped through the Cevennes with a donkey named Modestine and discovered the delights of Travels with a Donkey .
     [java] 
     [java] Something or someone was following them , treading through the trees on the side of the track .
     [java] 
     [java] She could trek through the grass playing Jungle Explorers , swinging on the creepers like a tiny Tarzan .
     [java] 
     [java] Privacy was not a word in our vocabulary , and postcards and diaries were mercilessly read aloud as we trekked through the jungle of North Borneo .
     [java] 
     [java] Tripping through the graveyard with its crusty old tombs and tippling slabs had made her uneasy even though it was broad daylight .
     [java] 
     [java] They trooped through the sunlit darkness , keeping close together , and came out halfway up the hill on to the slope where the blackberries grew .
     [java] 
     [java] We trudge through thick grass , bright green matted fur in its soaked richness .
     [java] 
     [java] He vaulted cleanly through the open window , brushed his hair back and sauntered around Stefan 's room , picking up his record book , his razor , his hat .
     [java] 
     [java] He dived under the fence and a moment later the ducks began waddling through the tunnel and into the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] But if you are n't prepared to wade through acres of news and advertising print , your financial adviser should be able to pick out a few plans that suit your needs .
     [java] 
     [java] But , wading through long grass and nettles in country churchyards , they found nothing .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The phone lines have n't stopped and we have yet to wade through the post bag .
     [java] 
     [java] This lets you get at the information without having to understand anything about databases and without having to wade through reams of data .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he waded through the banked snow to the foot of the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] And then , as if the slight sound which had broken from her throat was a signal , he quickly scooped her up in his arms , wading swiftly through the shallow water towards the sandy shore .
     [java] 
     [java] On one of his walks through Murray Park ( now King George VI Park ) he encountered a young Hispanic who was playing the guitar to himself .
     [java] 
     [java] There are many pleasant walks through the cool olive groves leading to abandoned villages , hilltop windmills with lovely views , or tiny coves among the cliffs of the west coast .
     [java] 
     [java] She loved fantasising about being his wife , wearing big hats , being chauffeur-driven and waltzing through the door of Number 10 if he got to be Prime Minister .
     [java] 
     [java] Thousands of people are expected to waltz through the factory on the open weekend at the end of the month .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's possible for a thief to wriggle through a remarkably small gap -- so even small windows like skylights or bathroom fanlights are vulnerable .
     [java] 
     [java] Sweating with fear she wriggled through the hole , then ducked under the freight car and crawled slowly forward on her belly between the two sets of rails .
     [java] 
     [java] There she was , alone , canoeing through white water , shooting rapids .
     [java] 
     [java] Jen 's involvement with her job was such that she could not bear to leave it and would have motored through the day on a couple of sandwiches .
     [java] 
     [java] She was motoring through Germany , though , when it suddenly dawned on her that she had n't asked Cara that most fundamental of questions -- when was she supposed to return to England ?
     [java] 
     [java] Martin Richmond , from Chalford in Gloucestershire , and a friend from London , pedalled through the Himalyas to establish what they believed was a new world altitude cycling record .
     [java] 
     [java] She freewheeled into the village , pedalled doggedly through it , then tackled the hill on the other side .
     [java] 
     [java] By 1981 there were so many people wanting to raft through the Canyon on the Colorado River that there was an eight-year waiting-list and places now have to be decided by a once-a-year lottery .
     [java] 
     [java] Eight hundred oarsmen and women will be rowing through Herefordshire to Wales in the River Wye Raft Race .
     [java] 
     [java] Spend five or ten minutes glancing through the book .
     [java] 
     [java] Seven-thirty came and she glanced through the curtains to see if she could see your car drawing up .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We 're managing to pick up the sound of one of the males , '' said a marine biologist , Vassili Papastavrou , as he listened intently through a set of headphones .
     [java] 
     [java] Jackson recently sat down and listened through his collected works , prior to making selections for the current live show , and found the thread wearing a little thin in places .
     [java] 
     [java] As far as the former is concerned we decide to find out where the electron is by shining a beam of light onto it and taking a look through a microscope .
     [java] 
     [java] Swan took a careful second look through the door .
     [java] 
     [java] What had possessed her to look through those field-glasses ?
     [java] 
     [java] The Admiral looked through the window of his cabin .
     [java] 
     [java] Galileo was one of the first to observe Jupiter through a telescope , and in 1610 he discovered four satellites which we now call the Galilean satellites .
     [java] 
     [java] Robbie observed him through lowered lashes as he made hearty inroads on the food .
     [java] 
     [java] A peek through the window showed that the taxi had arrived , brief farewells were made to the men , and Karl left , promising to ring them the next day and making mock threats to Erika and Paul should they forget to meet him the following Sunday .
     [java] 
     [java] Should I just take a peek through the windows of those double doors -- see if I can see him -- Vern 's dad ?
     [java] 
     [java] On April 19th a Soviet sentry shot and wounded a German major who was driving away after peeking through his binoculars at a Soviet ammunition depot .
     [java] 
     [java] Carefully he peeked through the glass window in the door .
     [java] 
     [java] When all was still I peeped tentatively through my fingers .
     [java] 
     [java] She wanted to go there at last and peep through wrought-iron gates into beautiful gardens .
     [java] 
     [java] Climb the hill and enter the echoing fifteenth-century Gothic church to peer through glass panels at the medieval foundations .
     [java] 
     [java] She peered anxiously through the glass doors into the reception area .
     [java] 
     [java] Irene felt increasingly outside the marriage and started `` spying through the window '' at the more complex-seeming Bosinney .
     [java] 
     [java] Shannon rolled on to her back , staring through tear-glazed eyes at the ceiling .
     [java] 
     [java] At one point a whole area steams gently so that the visitor can view the sun through a vapoury haze .
     [java] 
     [java] That is the scene before me now , except that the moon , riding low in its arc and viewed through the Earth 's dusty atmosphere , is spuriously tinged with gold .
     [java] 
     [java] He also observed that the apparent size of Mars and Venus , as viewed through the telescope , changed in the way predicted by the Copernican system .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'd feel the prickly cases through my gloves ,
     [java] 
     [java] I was fully clothed , how come I could feel the warmth through my sweater ?
     [java] 
     [java] Some people who have become severely deafened do not wear rubber soles on their shoes because they can only feel the vibration through the floor when wearing leather soles .
     [java] 
     [java] I felt it through the seat of my pants , and grinned .
     [java] 
     [java] She put a hand on his arm and felt the rhythmic shivering through the stuff of his jacket .
     [java] 
     [java] You feel a soft click through your fingers before you have pressed a key as far as it will go .
     [java] 
     [java] Even though he only heard it through his right ear .
     [java] 
     [java] When he was n't teaching , Malik was usually on the phone , and you could hear him through the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] She experimented with her new optic , shifting her patch to her right eye and perceiving the world through heat patterns .
     [java] 
     [java] The apparently outward world , perceived through our senses , is actually of the mind .
     [java] 
     [java] Like the silkmoth , ants sense pheromones through their antennae ; but they make continual use of both antennae to keep them in the right direction .
     [java] 
     [java] Passengers smell the scented Welsh air through the windows of four coaches all of which have bodies designed and built at Henllan by Society member John Eden .
     [java] 
     [java] It had taken almost half an hour to reach his office along streets jammed with tourist coaches , the Americans inside staring through the windows at the neon Tel Aviv highway sign that glowed through the drizzle .
     [java] 
     [java] Only rarely does the leer of insincerity glow through the mask .
     [java] 
     [java] Oily water glittered through gaps in the teak boards as we climbed the gangplank .
     [java] 
     [java] The levees of the former rivers through the Fens are now marked by raised banks , or roddons , which have been favoured settlement sites due to their comparative dryness .
     [java] 
     [java] In unfavourable circumstances erosion may be so great as to tear a gap through the dunes , such a feature being described as a blow out .
     [java] 
     [java] There was talk some time ago of constructing a motor road through the pass , extending the present road alongside Loch Arkaig through Glen Pean and over the pass .
     [java] 
     [java] The loggers build roads through the jungle to reach the trees and bring diseases which the Indians have no defences against which kill them .
     [java] 
     [java] Greeted by record breaking ice floes , the ship is pictured here en route to Montreal with the Canadian ice breaker , Terry Fox cutting a path through thick patches of ice on the S Lawrence River .
     [java] 
     [java] New highways through the rainforest lead to boom-town development , destruction and dereliction ; reservoirs from flooded valleys ( intended to generate clean , cheap electricity ) silt up , thanks to the soil erosion caused by clearfelling of the protective forest cover on surrounding slopes .
     [java] 
     [java] The A5 meanwhile would be converted into a motorway through Snowdonia .
     [java] 
     [java] Even if we force it past our lot by getting the Whips to chew a few backbench bollocks , the rural lords will junk it , they do n't want motorways through their game parks ``
     [java] 
     [java] No 37109 brings a freight off the Dundee line through platform No 1 at Perth station on 8 September 1987 .
     [java] 
     [java] The task force planned to cut a track through a corridor of forest running along the edge of the settlement to the elephants ' new sanctuary 50 km away .
     [java] 
     [java] The workers , scurrying along the tracks through the undergrowth , are blind and sterile .
     [java] 
     [java] The crowds who gathered on Alexanderplatz and then moved off on a winding trail through East Berlin were in any case convinced he was their man .
     [java] 
     [java] By a lucky accident we had already trekked ( with Mohammed ) from Imlil westwards to the Nfis , discovering superb trails through a bold landscape .
     [java] 
     [java] However , by the time we had spotted the first speck through our high-powered binoculars , the vulture was already descending .
     [java] 
     [java] He spotted her through the steam-smeared glass , sitting at the bar lost in thought .
     [java] 
     [java] David took out the list Pamela had given him and skimmed through the columns of neat , rounded handwriting .
     [java] 
     [java] Maxine rushed to a pink file that lay on one of the opium beds , then stretched back against mauve and blue silk cushions as she skimmed through the newspaper clippings .
     [java] 
     [java] She skims through the novel which seems to fascinate them .
     [java] 
     [java] Killion rummaged through the bedside locker .
     [java] 
     [java] Rose rummaged through her skirts .
     [java] 
     [java] Electing to leave him to his own devices , I wave through the windscreen but he is still fumbling through his camera bag and does n't say goodbye .
     [java] 
     [java] She was hunting through her bag when someone tapped at the door .
     [java] 
     [java] She went in , hunted through the cupboards until she found everything she needed , then cooked herself a large meal .
     [java] 
     [java] Tell you what , you hunt through the file , see if we have a case history on Miss Duncan .
     [java] 
     [java] In fact , one of the main advantages of using IFAs is that they can hunt through the range of mortgage offers and find the best deal for you .
     [java] 
     [java] Staff at South Tyrone Hospital are now combing through all their patients ' files over a three year period between 1988 and 1990 .
     [java] 
     [java] The stag breathed heavily through its nose .
     [java] 
     [java] I tried breathing through the sleeves of my tracksuit .
     [java] 
     [java] Manfred inhaled powerfully through his nose and held his breath while he stared at the stars and listened to the tiny howl of life in his ears .
     [java] 
     [java] An armed response unit reached the bank within minutes and a police helicopter hovered overhead , but the robber had escaped through the back of the building empty-handed .
     [java] 
     [java] On the final day of the war thousands of disorganized Iraqi troops attempted to flee north through Basra but were unable to find a means to cross the Shatt-al-Arab waterway as all bridges had been destroyed by allied aircraft .
     [java] 
     [java] The injured man was supported by his colleague as they got out and fled through a security gate .
     [java] 
     [java] This means that you could for example , take the pieces of garment originally designed for conventional knitting and rotate them through 90 degrees to get a pattern for sideways knitting .
     [java] 
     [java] Miss Kenton was still waiting for me in the hallway and we ascended through the house in silence .
     [java] 
     [java] Apgood skimmed through Brigitte Schickert 's certificate , her husband 's name , parents ' names , place and date of birth , and the address of the Leistritz farmhouse , Dornhausen .
     [java] 
     [java] She skimmed through the list of honours and achievements until she reached the end of the sentence : `` died on Saturday at The Cedars where he had made his home for the past twelve years . ''
     [java] 
     [java] She skims through the novel which seems to fascinate them .
     [java] 
     [java] One was headed `` Science Goes Too Far ! '' and Mike skimmed swiftly through the heavy black print .
     [java] 
     [java] I could picture that : a Technicolor sunrise , and three singing sailors swarming through the docks .
     [java] 
     [java] A wolfpack of ragged children swarmed through the streets , snatching at whatever was insufficiently guarded .
     [java] 
     [java] Anyone who went to the tall ships race in Belfast and saw 500,000 people thronging through the city centre day after day could see the determination of the people of Belfast to lead their lives normally .
     [java] 
     [java] Tourists still thronged through Stratford , although not in such overwhelming numbers as in the spring and summer .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Millions of people are streaming through those airports and they are all potential customers . ''
     [java] 
     [java] They were streaming through the connecting door , muttering discontentedly and clutching their books and papers as they looked hopelessly around for somewhere to sit .
     [java] 
     [java] Travel restrictions are abolished and over 2,000,000 East Germans flood through the Berlin Wall over the next two days [ pp. 37024-25 ] .
     [java] 
     [java] Now those enemies were pouring through non-existent defences and laying waste the cities of the Reich .
     [java] 
     [java] As the dust cleared Duregar saw Dwarfs pouring through the gateway towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] On a freezing October Monday like this , the visitors are n't exactly flocking through the gates .
     [java] 
     [java] It would be too humiliating to have to contact her mother through her publishers or her employers .
     [java] 
     [java] Please contact me through Woodworker .
     [java] 
     [java] On Boxing Day she put a short note through Doris 's door with her little bit of news and positively ran back home , feeling suddenly young again and full of energy .
     [java] 
     [java] `` He put his arm through the partition and I saw something glinting in the darkness .
     [java] 
     [java] They put water through the window and then got the door down , just knocked it down .
     [java] 
     [java] Your glasses and keys you put through a small slot .
     [java] 
     [java] Money showered through the yellow air .
     [java] 
     [java] He said : `` The car had crashed through a wall and had overturned in a marshy field .

     [java] Police said a lone gunman hiding in undergrowth fired through the security fencing and hit Mr Gallagher in the back several times as he got out of a builder 's van .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , almost so certain as to be positive that he could not abide a clinging type of woman , she hooked her arm through his .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm certain he 'd hooked his umbrella through the handles of the handbag and pulled it out , right under our very eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] Should we not include people who regularly travel through the area by car , who must have an opinion about the difference it has made to their journey ?
     [java] 
     [java] For two years he travelled through Britain convalescing .
     [java] 
     [java] At the age of 16 he travelled through the Far East and went to Australia to work on a sheep station .
     [java] 
     [java] Then I made one last journey through the house , the precincts , and the gardens , to see that all was as it should be , and to say goodbye .
     [java] 
     [java] INTREPID traveller Derek Reeves will be discussing his marathon journey through China next month .
     [java] 
     [java] The lecture had allowed a mental flight ; now vigour flowed through her limbs .
     [java] 
     [java] The sap flowed easily through her veins .
     [java] 
     [java] Some changes may come in the `` bottom-up '' review now bubbling through the Pentagon ; others could be brought in when the organisation gets a new boss .
     [java] 
     [java] I was comforted by the little natural light that seeped through the canvas .
     [java] 
     [java] Her tears seeped through the cotton mattress of her cot and fell onto the European stones .
     [java] 
     [java] He holds a soggy triangle of chips , the grease seeping through the paper .
     [java] 
     [java] The normally immaculate room was a dirty mess , and pus was oozing through a leg ulceration into a bandage that looked several days old .
     [java] 
     [java] Water oozed through the sodden cardboard inner soles , hastily fitted over the holes in my cheap plastic shoes as I stood in the rain outside the courtroom .
     [java] 
     [java] Soon the smoke began to leak through her clothes until the ensuing fog convinced me as always that she would set herself alight .
     [java] 
     [java] Marvin shrieked like a gutshot coyote as the dark , boiling liquid soaked through the front of his shirt and trousers , staining black his belly , groin and upper thighs .
     [java] 
     [java] By the time he made it the sleet had soaked through every layer of his clothing .
     [java] 
     [java] I remember thinking that the soldier had a face now , and though his head remained slobbering in her breast when I plunged the blade through the thick khaki , I saw the sudden sharp pain jolt through his eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] From the High Street proceed through St Clements and up Headington Hill .
     [java] 
     [java] Six sulky girls sidled through the door .

     [java] 
     [java] Daylight streamed through the aircraft windows .
     [java] 
     [java] Morning light streamed through the window searching out the shabbiness and the dust , the peeling walls and cobwebbed corners .
     [java] 
     [java] The light faded , leaves fell , and a fine snow drifted through the air , vanishing below her .
     [java] 
     [java] Each time she thought she had caught hold of the essential man he turned out to be as nebulous as the sea mist drifting through her fingers .
     [java] 
     [java] In both , the characters drift somnambulistically through life , unconsciously impelled by emotions of which not only they , but also the author , can give little or no account .
     [java] 
     [java] A cool breeze drifted through the open window , carrying with it the sound of water trickling softly from the old stone fountain they 'd painstakingly renovated in the inner courtyard .
     [java] 
     [java] Something had blown through the room with him , a gust of exhilarating air trapped in the folds of his garments , leaving a breath of his own vigour behind .

     [java] The huge net dropped steadily through the gap between the coiled cargo extensors , its pulleys whining .
     [java] 
     [java] He had dropped through the hole into a corridor that looked typical of every space station Ace had ever been on .
     [java] 
     [java] Harvey dropped through a large hole in the ice .
     [java] 
     [java] It was n't dropping through the thin wisps of cloud up there , it was simply pushing them aside .
     [java] 
     [java] It was broad daylight when I read this passage and the sunlight that radiated through the high plate-glass windows illuminated a scene of modernity and order .
     [java] 
     [java] From our balcony we could see pots floating through the doorway and the family wading in and out in their bare feet .
     [java] 
     [java] Ondine , the sea nymph ( Margot Fonteyn ) so used her feet that she appeared always to float through water .
     [java] 
     [java] Noisy voices floated through their windows .
     [java] 
     [java] Imagine you are flying through the air -- raise both arms and legs simultaneously .
     [java] 
     [java] We got lost in Nuneaton trying to get back on the M6 , and were now heading through Lancashire at dusk , still an hour or more from the border .
     [java] 
     [java] He turns back to face the front as we head through the late traffic .
     [java] 
     [java] I keep crouched and make my way through the low bushes , heading diagonally through the wood towards the estate .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , almost alone , he awaited his fate , and as the British troops stormed through the gateway of his stronghold he shot himself with a pistol sent to him in happier days by Queen Victoria .
     [java] 
     [java] The hedgehogs could hear its tremendous feet crunching through the weeds as it bounded away .
     [java] 
     [java] The alignment of the bypass through the Baberton/Westburn areas required the permanent closure of Baberton Mains Terrace -- thus the housing area at Baberton would have only one entry point .
     [java] 
     [java] Judge Diamond ruled that Barrett had obtained the pieces through fraudulent misrepresentation and ordered him to return them .

     [java] 
     [java] Armies of monkeys marching through the jungle roof on swinging arms took fright , too , when they saw the little file of humans and they fled chattering through the upper branches almost as speedily as the birds .

     [java] 
     [java] The snag to this is that although a pan-head can rotate through a full circle , your hips are limited to about a quarter of this movement .
     [java] 
     [java] Its beams shone through a gap in the pastel blue curtains .
     [java] 
     [java] Clear yellow sunlight shone through the window-panes , making a pattern of diamonds on the plasterwork .
     [java] 
     [java] Dappled sunlight glints through the trees into the water , illuminating the river bed .
     [java] 
     [java] Candlelight flickered through the clear glass of a hurricane lamp , softly illuminating her face .
     [java] 
     [java] Sunlight flickered through the trees
     [java]

     [java] Karen threw her arms round my neck , spilling champagne everywhere .

     [java] He ran up to her , throwing his arms round her , but saying nothing .
     [java] 
     [java] The nurse came to the bed to fix it and as she bent her head down the woman threw her left hand round the warm brown neck and pulled it to her .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Chalk was clattering round in the kitchen , and a savoury aroma was wafting from that region .
     [java] 
     [java] The wind that blew tin cans along the streets of the dormitory suburb where I was growing up was the same wind that howled round peak and scar and wrested piccolo tunes from the reed patches below the drystone walls .
     [java] 
     [java] And , after all those earlier occasions when he had carefully skirted round the subject of Elise , was this , at long last , a confession of his involvement ?
     [java] 
     [java] Troop Sergeant Haines brought up the rear as the raiders moved towards the Old Entrance lock bridge ( 'G' ) but had first to swing north round the buildings on the east of the basin .
     [java] 
     [java] The precession of the satellite 's orbit -- the way it swings slowly round the Earth -- will mean that successive 30o-segments will overlap by 15o , so assisting the procedure of confirming sources .
     [java] 
     [java] As the bus swung slowly round Loxford green , Anna saw that two immense removal vans were parked in the drive of Loxford Old Rectory .
     [java] 
     [java] Ships are advised to give the islands a wide berth , as the seabed is constantly shifting and massive magnetic anomalies cause compasses to swing wildly round the rose .
     [java] 
     [java] Inside the shrine the bells start ringing , rhythmically clanging as they swing up and down , round in an arc as the cord is pulled and released .
     [java] 
     [java] The car swung round a corner into the dusty main road .
     [java] 
     [java] The path traverses round this peak and leads down to the Old Church of Martindale ( 2.5 miles ) .
     [java] 
     [java] `` OK , Patsy , '' he mumbled as his young brother weaved round him .
     [java] 
     [java] Narrow paved streets that are little more than alleys wind informally round a low ridge once densely packed with houses .
     [java] 
     [java] Burnt brick paving wound round islands of rock gardens , fountains and mature trees , baubled with multicoloured hanging baskets peeking through their pea-green wisteria like leaves .
     [java] 
     [java]  Round about Grace herself the great river deposited little but mounds of plastic containers .
     [java] 
     [java] A counsellor commented : `` They always assumed I 'd do disability counselling ; they were hanging a label round my neck . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It is very easy to put the apostles on a sort of Olympic rostrum , and think that God will hang a gold medal round Paul 's neck , while we get some kind of lesser award .
     [java] 
     [java] I 've planted a selection round one the little paved areas .
     [java] 
     [java] Shelley 's hands were clutched tightly round the mug of coffee , and Rosie wisely let her talk it out of her system .
     [java] 
     [java] She tucked a towel round his neck , not quite managing to meet his knowing look .
     [java] 
     [java] It also enabled him to wrap his hand round the glass , even if it had a handle , in a manner peculiarly his own .
     [java] 
     [java] But as usual all I saw was the hairy form bounding away out of sight round the corner of the house .
     [java] 
     [java] A trio of enormous hounds came bounding round the building , causing Cleo to gasp in alarm .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The fire blazes up and men and boys dance merrily round it and keep the sport till the fire burns low enough , when they venturously leap through the flames '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Frederick was dancing round Mister Johnny , twisting one side of his face in grotesque imitation and fluttering his hands .

     [java] 
     [java] A few days later when Tess came back from looking for work , the children came running out and danced round her .
     [java] 
     [java] He danced about round the man 's feet , trying to get to the steps , but always slithering out of reach when the arm came too near him .
     [java] 
     [java] He seemed completely in his element , though all those monks flitting round the place rather gave me the creeps .
     [java] 
     [java] Charles and I are so sorry to miss you and most grateful to you for guarding our chattels while we gallivant round Italy .
     [java] 
     [java] Hastening round the keep they came up against unexpected obstruction .
     [java] 
     [java] An inner excitement gripped me as I saw in my mind 's eye an image of Clare trying to hobble round her bedroom .
     [java] 
     [java] I laid the sturdy Ministry of Defence plastic mug on the sand and then hopped round to the front of my tent to bring out my dirty washing .
     [java] 
     [java] She now hurried round the corner and into the yard and there she knocked on the back staircase door .
     [java] 
     [java] Lord John was hurrying round the edge of the room , making for a back entrance , but Sharpe simply took the direct route which meant jumping from table to table straight across the room .
     [java] 
     [java] `` He stayed in his room when his wife went off for a jaunt round Oxford , remember ?
     [java] 
     [java] Our impression over a two week jaunt round the Republic was of a country shedding the shackles of its tortured past without sacrificing its most endearing features .
     [java] 
     [java] They jogged round a corner , and found themselves in what passed for the town square of Dead Rat , Arizona .
     [java] 
     [java] Ace kept moving , jogging round the inside of the base 's perimeter wall , programming one mine after another as she ran .
     [java] 
     [java] Down below , through thick double-glazing , red buses lumbered in uncanny silence round Darnley town centre .
     [java] 
     [java] Although Jacques rarely addressed anyone as he marched round the acre of kitchen except to grunt his approval or disapproval -- the latter more commonly -- Mark quickly learned to anticipate his needs .
     [java] 
     [java] Now , he stood up and began to pace purposefully round the room , making Ari 's head whirl as she tried to follow him with her eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] He paced round the bed .
     [java] 
     [java] He could hear the muffled sound of the train as it plodded round the curves .
     [java] 
     [java] He was wearing the unobtrusive shabby clothes with soft shoes that would allow him to plod round the streets without being noticed .
     [java] 
     [java] Then they plodded round a circular mill , crushing the cider apples .
     [java] 
     [java] There were better things in life , for a young man like him , than plodding round London after a pick-pocket .
     [java] 
     [java] Occasionally he came in on her while she was engaged in odd projects -- dressing up and prancing round their small bedroom , or reciting .
     [java] 
     [java] Well , it had n't changed much , except that it was bigger and a lot of schoolboys were apparently prancing round the sacred portals of Pierremont House .
     [java] 
     [java] Nathan was becoming very wary of all the secrets prowling round the complex at Acropolis Park .
     [java] 
     [java] Graham Hunsley , defending , told the court Melia had been roaming round the country for about a month and stole the jeans after becoming concerned about his scruffy appearance .
     [java] 
     [java] Children and colts , two of a kind , rushed round and round the field in exhilaration .
     [java] 
     [java] The barman rushed round the counter and grabbed my arm urgently , muttering : `` This way , Sir , this way please .
     [java] 
     [java] PC Sparkes lodged his bike against Carter 's fence , knocked on the door and , getting no reply , he sauntered round the premises peering through each window -- nothing seemed out of place or obviously suspicious .
     [java] 
     [java] Four photographers scampered round the podium , halting to squint through their viewfinders and freeze the scene with their flashlights .
     [java] 
     [java] A gentle breeze helped nudge us up the first incline -- then the next , and the next , before we reached a tricky scramble round a rocky peak .
     [java] 
     [java] Watching her parents scramble round the slippery rocks , she savoured the thought .
     [java] 
     [java] He scurries round the numerous vantage points , peering down into the camera .
     [java] 
     [java] But a lull in Burnley 's flurries saw Tony Daws leap on to a bad back-pass , skip round a defender and the converging goalkeeper and equalise just after the hour .
     [java] 
     [java] She skipped in circles round the silent chamber , her great head bobbing like a bird 's .
     [java] 
     [java] He is a great example to anyone who has a setback and it is marvellous to hear how he has put adversity behind him as he sets out on the long slog round the tough pro circuit once again .
     [java] 
     [java] If you 're going to sneak round the place whenever it suits you , I 'd rather be back in the hotel .
     [java] 
     [java] I sneaked round the front , thankful for the thick hedge .
     [java] 
     [java] The emphasis is on the word `` gentle '' , and that 's a good idea first thing in the morning , because the body does not like being rudely awakened from a deep sleep by 50 press-ups and a sprint round the block .
     [java] 
     [java] When the 1992 intake of new MPs took their first tentative steps round Westminster on Monday morning , the place was in turmoil .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he opened his eyes , spoke a few words and eventually tried a few tentative steps round his hospital room .
     [java] 
     [java] I stepped round him and went back to the house .
     [java] 
     [java] She walked slowly up the street on the shaded side , stepping carefully round the stalls set up on the pavement and the goods displayed by some vendors which were spread out on cloths on the pavement itself .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Ah Christ , '' he says , leaving her and stomping round the room .
     [java] 
     [java] She thrust back the chair and strode round the desk , her two hands locked together and her whole figure trembling with rage .
     [java] 
     [java] He strode round the corner into Claughton Street , almost colliding with a gang of children who had collected round Pol O'Gorman 's cart .
     [java] 
     [java] He walked between the pines and the cactus as if he were out for a stroll round his estate after dinner .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It 's about time I took a stroll round the club .
     [java] 
     [java] Eventually we decided that , as it was such a lovely evening , we 'd stroll round the village .
     [java] 
     [java] Instead he took a curtain call , and at the last minute before he was to slide behind the curtains behind the bar , he reached for the flowers thrown to him earlier and broke off some of the roses , swaggering round the circle of admirers handing out the roses to the women .
     [java] 
     [java] The result was that the Seayak went for an unscheduled underwater swim round campsite bay .
     [java] 
     [java] So I walked down to the sea and before long , I was at the ship and was swimming round it .
     [java] 
     [java] They swam slowly together round the boat .
     [java] 
     [java] I heard the clink of coins , smiled and tiptoed round the bed .
     [java] 
     [java] We were like western liberals tiptoeing round Stalin 's Russia , anxious to find it good , afraid to find fault .
     [java] 
     [java] Nicola tottered round the table on her high heels and slid her buttocks on to the table .
     [java] 
     [java] At dusk , it has not been unknown for us to traipse round the dykeside field boundaries collecting slugs , a pretty grisly business .
     [java] 
     [java] Colour Counsellors is an interior design company whose franchises help you put together fabrics , carpets and wallpapers without tramping round the shops for samples .
     [java] 
     [java] She sat like that for what seemed like ages while I tramped round the room , nervous and on edge and blabbering with the excitement .
     [java] 
     [java] She rose , tripping round the table as if Benjamin had asked her for a dance .
     [java] 
     [java] Half of them were old , bald men who nearly lost their elastic-waisted pants as they trotted round corners , puffing and blowing .
     [java] 
     [java] I put my pyjamas on underneath my clothes and thus protected went for a walk round Pau .
     [java] 
     [java] Trace the eras of fortification as you wander round the Roman ruins and enter the courtyard and rooms of the castle through the gatehouse .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Well , I bicycled round Siena with a gun in the basket on my handlebars , underneath my exercise books and Petrarch 's sonnets .
     [java] 
     [java] He was a familiar face in the City as he cycled round each evening with his pole , lighting the gas lamps in the streets .
     [java] 
     [java] The number of top lady paddlers in sprint , shalom and coaching is legion and it would be invidious of me to select names although one has honoured canoeing by being awarded an MBE a few years ago and more recently one has completed almost the ultimate in canoe expeditions by paddling round the Horn .
     [java] 
     [java] As the Vikings rowed their warships round the north of Scotland , past Cape Wrath , their `` turning point '' , down the ragged west coast of their `` South Land '' , they saw Suilven as a single , dramatic pillar ; and they named it Sul Val , the pillar mountain .
     [java] 
     [java] Paul Binyon followed Culley 's gaze round the bleak room .
     [java] 
     [java] He swore softly , colourfully , his face like granite as he swept a gaze round the room before lifting her into his arms and carrying her from the house .
     [java] 
     [java] He glanced cautiously round the graveyard .
     [java] 
     [java] She glanced anxiously round the treatment area .
     [java] 
     [java] I get up and have a look round the room , but things are blurry on account of my tears and I ca n't find her fags .
     [java] 
     [java] I have a look round the shop while Marie gets changed .
     [java] 
     [java] She took a last look round the room which had been her world , then hurried quickly out of the house .
     [java] 
     [java] Suddenly he rose from his chair , gave a quick look round the office , then went across to the window , where he stood looking down into the courtyard .
     [java] 
     [java] And that would be the extent of his visit , he would have a cursory look round the yard and away .
     [java] 
     [java] Joseph looked wildly round the throne room , expecting to see the emperor and the Resident Superior bolting for cover .
     [java] 
     [java] The front of the machine sports some graceful curves , but it 's only when you take a peek round the back that you get some inkling that this one is different .
     [java] 
     [java] No noise came so I peeked round the door .
     [java] 
     [java] But I knew I had to look , so slowly I peeped round the door .
     [java] 
     [java] The door opened suddenly and Rachel 's coy face peered round it .
     [java] 
     [java] He stared slowly round the rest of the group .
     [java] 
     [java] Ronni stood and stared round her , eyes wide with pleasure .
     [java] 
     [java] In the evenings , after a dinner collected by the ladies from along the road , we huddled round the fire , playing bridge .
     [java] 
     [java] Walking up from the main road we passed the camel drivers squatting round their early morning fires .
     [java] 
     [java] They stabled their horses round the back and bedded amongst dry hay with their cloaks wrapped round them .
     [java] 
     [java] His eyes narrowed briefly , then he draped the jacket round her shoulders before leading the way to the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] But Caliban would drape a tarpaulin round it .
     [java] 
     [java] He draped tinsel round the pink lampshades on the table .
     [java] 
     [java] Penry returned quickly with a warm , dry towel , which he draped round her shoulders as he took her wrist in his .
     [java] 
     [java] I can see her little gold necklace twinkling like a star round her neck .
     [java] 
     [java] Sabine unfastened the chain round her neck , and put the medallion gently into the Baronne 's hand .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] He padded about in his freedom with a towel knotted round his waist and put some toast to grill .

     [java] 
     [java] The rope round his neck went slack .
     [java] 
     [java] It yelped and struggled , the green cord round its waist waggling to and fro .
     [java] 
     [java] She turned , arms flailing , head back , eyes open -- but the gaping mouth would utter no more prophecies , her breath cut off by the red garrotte cord round her scrawny neck .

     [java] 
     [java] Diana daubed luminous paint on the eyes of her cuddly green hippo so that at night it seemed as though he was keeping watch and looking after her .
     [java] 
     [java] I suppose it 's because people do n't put canvas with paint daubed on it very high up on their list of personal needs , especially when there are bills to pay and food to buy
     [java] 
     [java] Gardeners are often advised not to sow roots on ground that has recently been manured , as this will produce distorted shapes .

     [java] Shirts and sheets they hung from the ceiling , draping them on lines and hangers .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] I crushed some of the flowers and rubbed them on my forehead as I 'm told it has an invigorating effect on cabbages and thought it might do the same for me .

     [java] `` I bring expertise on general financial and technical matters . ''
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The line manager recognises that the staff manager has greater knowledge and expertise on this subject and acquiesces in the carrying out of the prescribed steps of the procedure .
     [java] 
     [java] I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention , because his expertise on this subject is well known , as is his general understanding of the problems involved .
     [java] 
     [java] When Pitt wants to have a good time he invites his `` little group of buddies '' , including actor Dermot Mulroney -- a whiz on the cello -- over for an old-fashioned `` hootinanny '' jam session .
     [java] 
     [java] He believed that , by its means , we could arrive at certainty on such matters .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Ladbrokes drastically revised their price on the Henry Cecil-trained colt , pushing him out to 8-13 ( from 2-5 ) and Coral now quote 4-7 .
     [java] 
     [java] Dinah turned a radiant smile on him .
     [java] 
     [java] He was quite calm , a slight smile on his lips , a kind of self-sufficiency there that Munro had noticed in many airborne soldiers .
     [java] 
     [java] The grins on men 's faces grew broader .
     [java] 
     [java] I had a permanent grin on my face about it all .
     [java] 
     [java] Kersey watched him go , an appreciative grin on his face .
     [java] 
     [java] The grin on Turner 's face disappeared for a startled moment .

     [java] `` Do be careful , love , '' said his wife , a frown on her forehead and a worried tone to her voice .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Forgotten ? '' asked Joan , her tinkling laughter deepening the frown on the other girl 's face .
     [java] 
     [java] She looked away , made uneasy by the threatening expression on his harsh features .
     [java] 
     [java] Everything within her wanted to fight him , but the forbidding expression on his harsh features , and the unmistakable threat in his voice , told her in no uncertain manner she 'd regret it if she did .
     [java] 
     [java] I thought I detected a smirk on the face of Mills Roberts .
     [java] 
     [java] The scowl on his face indicated displeasure , and after a moment 's silence she asked , `` Is anything the matter ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] The snarl on his face , twisted horribly with contempt , was terrifying to behold but worse was the way he wiped the saliva away from his slobbering mouth with his sleeve and seemed to cast it towards her .
     [java] 
     [java] It seemed he had been behind the same car for hours now -- a Jaguar whose iridescent blue reminded Dexter of oil shimmering on the surface of a puddle .
     [java] 
     [java] I wondered if she might ever get frostbite ; I was sure I could see little crystals of ice glinting on her faint moustache .
     [java] 
     [java] A security guard came to smile at our picnic on the grass .
     [java] 
     [java] Now in that room at Fontainebleau so many years ago , I studied Francis but my eyes were drawn to that bloody ring which sparkled on the fourth finger of his left hand .

     [java] Tears sparkled on her lashes .
     [java] 
     [java] Flecks of rain sparkled on the shoulders of his navy-blue overcoat .

     [java] 
     [java] Thin threads of blood glittered on his forehead and cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] Pearl chokers glittered on every female neck ; huge diamonds flashed in the strobe lights .
     [java] 
     [java] Jailed shadows flickered on the walls .
     [java] 
     [java] The car gave a roar , then slowly moved out of the garage ; the dim side-lights showed a pale flicker on the back of the house , then swung around for an instant on to the gardens .
     [java] 
     [java] The sheen on the long hair quickened his desire and the music in her voice surprised him .
     [java] 
     [java] Nothing was in my mind beyond vague , pleasant plans of a domestic sort , and the sight of the pink sheen on the breast feathers of the doves , and the sleepy sound of their cooing .
     [java] 
     [java] The sun illuminating the canopy of heaven , reflects its lustre on the earth below , and gives a delicate distinction to every distance on the picture , and to every object its due place , in all the regular gradation of aerial perspective . ''

     [java] 
     [java] The idea is to create huge solar lakes on the Dead Sea .
     [java] 
     [java] At the first pond on Hampstead Heath a raised brick platform juts out into the water .
     [java] 
     [java] THE agriculture minister , John Gummer , should have declared work paid for by a giant food company to restore a pond on his own land , MPs ruled last night .
     [java] 
     [java] Dr Mackintosh was a red-faced Scot with mousy greying hair parted in the middle and tiny gold-rimmed glasses on the tip of his rather short nose .

     [java] Tom shook his head , adjusting the glasses on his nose .
     [java] 
     [java] Every few minutes Jacques Devraux sent his trackers up the taller trees to scan the plain on the other side of the river , but each time they descended shaking their heads .
     [java] 
     [java] You will often find starfish in pools on the beach , and there are always plenty of gobies and blennies .
     [java] 
     [java] The rain was coming down more heavily now ; the car splashed through pools on the uneven road .
     [java] 
     [java] It can usually be found on banks of channels or around pools on the marshes .
     [java] 
     [java] You know , that in 1825 he bought an island on the Niagara River in America and offered it to all the Jews in the world to make a Jewish state called Ararat .

     [java] He was descended from Nevil Maskelyne [ q.v. ] , astronomer royal , who had a crater on the moon named after him .
     [java] 
     [java] It is possible that this surface , which is not entirely obliterated in the intercrater plains , predates almost all the craters on Mercury .
     [java] 
     [java] Some water collects in depressions on the surface ; these depressions vary in size from the minute to lakes covering hundreds of square miles .
     [java] 
     [java] But as Brown Owl pinned my Promise Badge on me , and said , `` I trust you to keep the Promise '' , the excitement must have been too much for Natalie !
     [java] 
     [java] She wore a naval greatcoat with brass buttons and some sort of goggles on her head .
     [java] 
     [java] The first two phases of the attack , on 26 and 30 October , along the ridges on either side of the Ravebeek Valley , made solid progress .

     [java] 
     [java] The Privy Seal is a seal fastened on royal documents .
     [java] 
     [java] The canal men at Gairlochy advised me to keep to the south-east of Loch Lochy and follow the disused rail track to Laggan instead of the forestry road on the other side .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] It was in March that the winner was revealed of a competition to build a bridge at Bloomer 's Hole to link the Thames Path on the Gloucestershire -- Oxfordshire border .
     [java]

     [java] How is an understanding of biological processes to be applied to the social world ?
     [java] 
     [java] However , the field approach was to surpass the action at a distance approach with Faraday 's discovery of electromagnetic induction and his invention of the electric motor , the dynamo and the transformer in the 1830s .
     [java] 
     [java] This represents a continuous stage of development , from the original discovery of the transistor .
     [java] 
     [java] The categorisation of countries is re-assessed regularly .
     [java] 
     [java] Gilbert Ryle in 1947 showed , however , that this dualism was based in a mistake in the categorization of ideas relating to the two terms .
     [java] 
     [java] The only unambiguous categorisations of people are by physical size , age and sex .
     [java] 
     [java] The categorization of social class used in these studies is the conventional one based on husband 's occupation .
     [java] 
     [java] If later words in the sentence suggested a different categorisation of the main verb , then re-interpretation of the sentence was possible with re-allocation of the case roles .
     [java] 
     [java] This means that the earlier categorisations of feminism ( socialist feminism , liberal feminism , radical feminism ) no longer work .
     [java] 
     [java] Unambiguous categorization of the users into staff , students , and others would be a useful first step .
     [java] 
     [java] The organisation is involved in the classification of carpets , and in the registering of `` quality '' names .
     [java] 
     [java] A classification of spearhead types has been made ( Swanton 1974 ) which shows how they have broad geographical distributions .
     [java] 
     [java] A traditional classification of the English courts is a division into `` superior '' and `` inferior '' courts .
     [java] 
     [java] The classification of species was still of vital importance to both field and museum naturalists .
     [java] 
     [java] The classification of gastritis was according to the Whitehead system modified to include the newly described entities of lymphocytic and chemical gastritis .
     [java] 
     [java] The interpretation of our experiment is also corroborated by results of other studies of the functional anatomy of phonological processing .
     [java] 
     [java] The ex-soldier 's comment suggests , contrary to the interpretation of the reporter , that there might be a perceived connection between tradition and the absence of discrimination .
     [java] 
     [java] But the musical analogy also suggests that the picture of the teacher giving an interpretation of his or her own research is likely to reduce the chances of an independent viewpoint being brought to bear .
     [java] 
     [java] He offers an interpretation of Greek drama , in come ways anticipating Hegel 's , which brings to the fore the question of tragic guilt .
     [java] 
     [java] Such conventions are prescribed neither by statute nor by judicial interpretation , so one must study instead scholarly interpretations of political behaviour and practice .
     [java] 
     [java] `` They have achieved this , we believe , through the appointment of a high profile director general and we would welcome consideration of a similar appointment at the Institute . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The last paragraph introduced the consideration of guilt and leads to this and another important factor of sexual dysfunction -- anger .
     [java] 
     [java] At present , however , we are still essentially at the stage of identifying different approaches to the consideration of strategy .
     [java] 
     [java] The four-and-a-half page Report was officially the sole product of the deliberations of fifteen MPs over forty days .
     [java] 
     [java] Political benefits : CMEA affords yet another institution for strengthening the Soviet voice in the internal policy deliberations of East Europe states .
     [java] 
     [java] Long-term planning took a back seat in the deliberations of the senior engineers whose efforts were principally devoted to overcoming short-term problems .
     [java] 
     [java] The deliberations of formal committee meetings are always recorded in the form of Minutes .
     [java] 
     [java] In addition , the deliberations of these committees were of course hampered and sometimes halted by teachers ' industrial action .
     [java] 
     [java] The secret deliberations of the Eisenhower administration show that allied ( and especially British ) advice and thinking received more attention than was realized at the time .
     [java] 
     [java] `` But after a long deliberation of all the circumstances , the Board agreed to sanction the contest on the conditions laid down . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Yet the conclusions of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys report are still disturbing .
     [java] 
     [java] We have told you about making wide margins , which will give you a quick view both of the skeleton of the subject and of the important findings and memorable conclusions of the study .
     [java] 
     [java] Our conclusions of three-dimensional paraconductivity are not sensitive to which extrapolation is used .
     [java] 
     [java] Ca n't tell you precisely what weapon , but my guess of a piece of lead piping wrapped in a sock is as good as any .
     [java] 
     [java] Had that guess of 3% proved right , GDP should comfortably have expanded by the same amount .
     [java] 
     [java] Such a graded response according to exposure can strengthen inferences of causality .
     [java] 
     [java] As the defendants were unable to rebut the inference of negligence they were liable .
     [java] 
     [java] The inference of user information needs from user information-seeking behaviour has led to much confusion .
     [java] 
     [java] Would you like to learn something of our history ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Anne had learned of the change in the royal fortunes from her mother .
     [java] 
     [java] These she would learn of only through other people .
     [java] 
     [java] `` From what I have learned of you , I would understand it less had you refused . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` Hopefully , following the tour to New Zealand , there is now a realisation of what needs to be done and of just how appalling we are in certain areas .
     [java] 
     [java] Recognition of the importance of spacing for maternal and child health followed relatively soon the realization of the effects of maternal age and birth order .
     [java] 
     [java] With it came the realisation of the meaning of the horrifying dream about the little muttering peasant .
     [java] 
     [java] Clearly , compared with our ability to make fine discriminations of perceptual qualities and immediately to recognize and discriminate amidst a profusion of ordinary objects , linguistic description may appear slow and clumsy .
     [java] 
     [java] Braille is a particularly useful tool for probing predictions from different models because it depends on fine discrimination of raised dot patterns , and a rule system of contractions .
     [java] 
     [java] Dr Barnett conceived of the idea for the exhibition whilst working on the catalogue raisonne of the works on paper , of which Volume I , covering the years 1900-1921 has already been published .
     [java] 
     [java] Hobbes conceived of what he called a state of nature .
     [java] 
     [java] Is it a modern myth that workers have rights -- a wicked concoction of trade unions ?
     [java] 
     [java] This was the artists concoctions of dream landscapes , borrowed myths , symbolic objects and classical figures of kings and fairytales .
     [java] 
     [java] He began to write more steadily , and his first book , Stories Toto Told Me , an idiosyncratic concoction of spleen and whimsy , was published in 1898 .
     [java] 
     [java] He saw the complicated contrivance of garden net and greenery .
     [java] 
     [java] The grunge and grime of pub rock has been credited with many things , including the invention of punk rock , but being remotely fashionable is n't one of them .
     [java] 
     [java] His knowledge of airships was at a premium , and his reputation had been enhanced by his patented invention of a carburettor that could burn hydrogen which was otherwise wasted on airship operations .
     [java] 
     [java] Only a year after the invention of balloons , a book was written describing a voyage , by balloon , to the newly discovered planet Uranus .
     [java] 
     [java] After all , one feels , Mrs Washington was surely a thrifty housewife ; had the invention of margarine occurred a century sooner than it did , no doubt she would have taken advantage of the development .
     [java] 
     [java] The phenomenon of popular authoritarianism is not altogether the invention of frightened bourgeois liberals .
     [java] 
     [java] Both these obsessions were based on Mr Carter 's invention of the `` alarm clock bed '' .
     [java] 
     [java] My grandfather had always taken a keen interest in my work , and I had an equal admiration of the stories of his time spent in Burma during the Second World War .
     [java] 
     [java] The display of honours was indiscriminate : alongside the insignia of a commandeur of the Legion d'honneur awarded by Giscard d'Estaing , a certificate of honorary citizenship of Disneyland aroused the admiration of the visitor to the museum .
     [java] 
     [java] For all his admiration of the Shah and his disdain for President Carter , Marenches did not suggest France as a possible destination .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's an attitude that 's earned the Davies 's the admiration of the officer in charge of the case .
     [java] 
     [java] The keepers also appear to be a knowledgeable and dedicated group of people , for whom I can only express my admiration of their hard work .
     [java] 
     [java] ( `` Filled with wonder at the sound of the bazouki , '' as Jacques Vassal commented ; also emphasising Leonard 's appreciation of Theodorakis 's then emerging art . )
     [java] 
     [java] I am sure the warm affinities between Scots and Jews arise out of appreciation of herrings .
     [java] 
     [java] Mockery from others over one 's appearance ; withdrawal of external appreciation of your beauty .
     [java] 
     [java] But Spenser 's appreciation of classical practice led him to weave interconnections between the separate actions and also to give Prince Arthur a part in each .
     [java] 
     [java] Always an important and influential patron of the arts , the Royal Family has recognised that a necessary part of any civilised person 's education is to acquire a knowledge and appreciation of painting .
     [java] 
     [java] Certainly , Jacques passed on Green 's approbation of Barker 's attitude to Hampden Jackson and Douglas-Smith a few days after the late February meeting :
     [java] 
     [java] Settlers , too , when they got the opportunity , liked to bask in what they supposed to be the approbation of the Masai .
     [java] 
     [java] As in biblical times , the king became `` the anointed one '' , but only with the approbation of the Church .
     [java] 
     [java] His inexcusable public blame of goalkeeper Eachus for the narrow defeat against Nicosia , when interviewed for television on arrival at Aldergrove .
     [java] 
     [java] The contempt of urban , middle-class educators for rural peasants was barely concealed : `` the psychological attitude of the Iranian villagers creates a great obstacle to rural reconstruction '' .
     [java] 
     [java] And they were so contemptuous of the Nazis and their cohorts they could not imagine that they themselves featured in the minds and machinations of such louts .
     [java] 
     [java] Poland was surrounded by neighbours who were contemptuous of its existence and anything but trustworthy , and Poland treated them as such .
     [java] 
     [java] He was rude to officials and contemptuous of backbenchers less successful in their careers than he had been since becoming MP for Putney in 1979 .
     [java] 
     [java] The majority of citizens were `` bystanders '' , and themselves often contemptuous of the victims .
     [java] 
     [java] The new fiction was contemptuous of modernistic tricks like stream-of-consciousness , which by the 1950s looked etiolated and , what is perhaps worse , un-English .
     [java] 
     [java] Even the KGB , notoriously contemptuous of satellite intelligence services , held him in considerable respect .
     [java] 
     [java] Contemptuous of rank or title , he rejected offers of honorary doctorates from Manchester , Edinburgh , and various American universities .
     [java] 
     [java] Marx was contemptuous of the `` sordid materialism '' of bureaucracy , and the constant struggles for promotion , status and prestige .
     [java] 
     [java] Ramsey always remained critical of Hoskyns .
     [java] 
     [java] Bala was outspokenly critical of Nigerian foreign policy which , he said , helped French `` imperialism '' and French-supported `` puppet regimes '' in West Africa .
     [java] 
     [java] Many psychologists have been critical of the discipline 's pathologization of racial `` others '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Holman is critical of the 1975 Children Act for taking no cognisance of the link between child separation and poverty .
     [java] 
     [java] Again like Calvin and his later disciples , Dame Julian agonises about the eternal damnation of those who are not numbered among the elect and struggles to square this with the goodness and love of God .
     [java] 
     [java] She sat on the edge of the bed and reminded Eileen what was at stake : the damnation of her soul .
     [java] 
     [java] The symbolic damnation of Saddam-Hitler may then reveal a great deal about the fears and anxieties , and maybe even the guilt , of this post-historical world .
     [java] 
     [java] But there had been no sign since Tiananmen Square that the Chinese had been in the least influenced by the disapproval of the West .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Gorbachev has not bothered to hide his disapproval of the way Mr Ceausescu and his family have ruled Romania .
     [java] 
     [java] The State Department , for example , has blocked the funds of scientists bound for Poland as an expression of political disapproval of the Polish regime .
     [java] 
     [java] For the Sex Pistols , Richard was prepared to weather the scornful disapproval of Eve and Ted on his even occasional visits to Shamley Green .
     [java] 
     [java] The six Hong Kong members of the BLDC subcommittee took the unprecedented step of publicly announcing their disapproval of the subcommittee 's proposals .
     [java] 
     [java] The move was interpreted more as a mechanism for displaying the North 's disapproval of the decision to proceed with Team Spirit than a direct response to South Korea 's military alert .
     [java] 
     [java] Author after author denounced Bush , the likely ( except to Surkov and his agent ) President of the United States , who disapproved of abortion .
     [java] 
     [java] Did he disapprove of all social events , or only of this one -- and if so , why had he come ?
     [java] 
     [java] Probably the reason why her therapist disapproved of her was not because she was -- from a psychiatric standpoint -- ill , but because she would n't get better .
     [java] 
     [java] He believed her to have been flirting , and disapproved of it .
     [java] 
     [java] In south Yorkshire during the forties , we were particularly disapproving of the sort of woman who `` puts on every bit of cheap jewellery that she 's got '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Descended from a devoutly religious family , he was mildly disapproving of Iran 's high society pleasure-seekers .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Is that why you were so disapproving of my apparent readiness to exploit your father 's generosity towards me ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] He has a disdain of showiness .
     [java] 
     [java] She had not quite the disdain of him that she put into what she said ; and perhaps he knew it as well as she did .
     [java] 
     [java] Although Anderson does not demonstrate a similar degree of pomposity when interrupted by the chairman , in scene eleven , it is here that he shows the most glaring disdain of politeness moves .
     [java] 
     [java] He is a gentleman of complete integrity , `` disdainful of all littleness and meanness '' , to whom honour has more importance than life itself .
     [java] 
     [java] Much as he mistrusted almost every Irishman with whom he came in contact on the Continent ( Bishop Clement for his disrespect of patristic authority , the priest Sampson for his cavalier attitude to the baptismal rite , Virgil of Salzburg for sowing dissension between himself and the duke of Bavaria as well as for believing that the world was round ) , Boniface 's establishing of monasteries as the learned back-up to missionary work and his devotion to the papacy and to Rome both owed something to the Irish background in England .
     [java] 
     [java] Honour , the esteem of both peer group and others , was something to be won in war .
     [java] 
     [java] Giving an employee more money may not motivate him/her if that individual needs to satisfy the desire for respect and the esteem of colleagues .
     [java] 
     [java] However , in this case a decision must be made and is often given on the flimsiest of grounds ( though that is not the fault of the refereeing panel ) .
     [java] 
     [java] `` John Patten seems to have learnt nothing from the faults of his predecessors , '' she said .
     [java] 
     [java] It was the fault of both World Cup and French Federation officials who showed a lack of sensitivity and insight .
     [java] 
     [java] That they took on the importance they did was in part the fault of the government .
     [java] 
     [java] It was a fault of his .
     [java] 
     [java] But with his back to the wall , and with the octopus bent on destroying him through no fault of his own , his first , last and only duty was to his family .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Fallon said the gaps were the fault of the Labour county council which had ignored nursery provision in Darlington until the election .
     [java] 
     [java] If a good mare becomes incapacitated , say , due to an accident through no fault of her own , then breeding from her could be practical .
     [java] 
     [java] Although used to the scorn of pop stars , I was saddened that The Smiths should act in this way ) .
     [java] 
     [java] The only thing that seemed to be stirring most people was their scorn of Chamberlain .
     [java] 
     [java] The right response to Democratic scorn of George Bush 's free-trade line is `` if only he 'd had one '' .
     [java] 
     [java] I have a scorn of him . ''
     [java] 
     [java] In achieving this remarkable success , Roddick has always been scornful of traditional business credos .
     [java] 
     [java] He was scornful of the latter .
     [java] 
     [java] Scott also worked with Ruskin in 1854 , when he added the chancel to the Camden Church at Camberwell , but as Ruskin turned his attention away from architecture he became scornful of Scott 's efforts .
     [java] 
     [java] He is absolutely right to be scornful of the pretentious organisational plans that often pass for science policy in developing countries .
     [java] 
     [java] His readings of heroic poems made him especially scornful of the notion that to say `` evil must be fought '' is the same as saying `` might is right '' .
     [java] 
     [java] At other times he was scornful of anhimsa , non-violence , and he criticised Gandhi and Nehru as `` philosophemes '' inclined to philosophical concepts which weakened the Indian nationalist movement .
     [java] 
     [java] They were so world-weary , scornful of everything that was n't perfectly proportioned or that they had n't thought of first .
     [java] 
     [java] Marxists and feminists are inclined to see this familiar fact as a form of exploitation , and the current fashion is to be particularly scornful of the honour that is supposed to accrue to the unpaid housewife .
     [java] 
     [java] Both Booth and Chamberlain argued that the state should provide old-age pensions of between 5s. and 10s. per week to enable those over sixty-five to live and die respectably , free from the stigma of pauperism .
     [java] 
     [java] The fear and stigma of mental disorder deter a public which is ignorant of the pressing need and unclear as to what their gifts might be used for .
     [java] 
     [java] The perceived social stigma of a tuberculosis diagnosis may be so severe as to cause people to avoid testing or treatment .
     [java] 
     [java] If the strictures of the Conservative party against the implications of socialism were implemented , there would be no housing benefit .
     [java] 
     [java] The fault clearly lies with Morgan , but Marx and especially Engels seem on the whole to have been surprisingly uncritical of their source .
     [java] 
     [java] A normal scientist must be uncritical of the paradigm in which he works .
     [java] 
     [java] He was nauseated by the absurdities of the faith propounded and the way it was presented .
     [java] 
     [java] But Hegley 's poetry is n't merely accessible ; as the absurdity of the lines builds in counterpoint to the serious manner , it becomes very , very funny indeed .
     [java] 
     [java] I smiled to myself at the absurdity of it .
     [java] 
     [java] Instead of criticizing himself , begging for forgiveness , and promising to follow the example of Comrade Ceau more closely in the future , Trofin launched into a tirade against the absurdity of Ceau 's methods of planning .
     [java] 
     [java] Humour at the absurdity of events .
     [java] 
     [java] A few jokes would help to open up the absurdity of the way things are . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Posing questions to which there are no satisfactory answers , Richter revels in the absurdity of all artistic activity -- and continues to paint .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Very astute of you , '' the Doctor said approvingly .
     [java] 
     [java] `` How very astute of you , Luke , '' she remarked .
     [java] 
     [java] Very astute of you to notice that .
     [java] 
     [java] Kate could n't stop her face from flaming at the astuteness of his answer , and sought to cover up her confusion in attacking him again .
     [java] 
     [java] And the most dangerous players in the world today are those athletic and financially secure ones who calculate risks with the astuteness of a bank manager , but go for the first prize , if possible , and the subsequent contracts , knowing that if the high-flying fairway wood does n't clear a ditch at Augusta , they can still enjoy a steak dinner tonight , thanks to a pitch and single putt !
     [java] 
     [java] One's admiration for the brilliance of Fussell 's writing can not suppress doubts about the partiality of the picture he is drawing , with all its entertaining anecdotes and quotes .
     [java] 
     [java] To some extent the very brilliance of the court life led by the sovereigns and its impact on public opinion was their undoing for the fete imperiale is indelibly associated with them .
     [java] 
     [java] Superb courage and unlimited patience supported an altogether exceptional political intelligence , and in both speech and writing he could express his beliefs with all the brilliance of a highly original mind
     [java] 
     [java] `` Bloody good , that 's brilliant of Rupert .
     [java] 
     [java] How canny of her to have chosen a new sweater with a roll neck .
     [java] 
     [java] `` My , my , that was careless of you .
     [java] 
     [java] Anthony would probably move on sooner or later ; his bosses , two Anglo-Italian academics , had already warned him about the carelessness of his work .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1940 , the school was badly damaged by fire -- not by enemy action , but ( it seems ) by the carelessness of fire-watchers installed at night to forestall such action .
     [java] 
     [java] I FELT compelled to reply immediately to your story about the four children robbed of a father this Christmas by the carelessness of an alleged drunken driver .
     [java] 
     [java] Often employers acknowledged no liability , blaming the carelessness of the worker , who might if the injuries were serious be thereafter unemployable .
     [java] 
     [java] How wide the sphere of the duty of care in negligence is to be laid depends ultimately on the court 's assessment of the demands of society for protection from the carelessness of others .
     [java] 
     [java] Forgive me for being a little cynical of that . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It was daft of their business partner to say every Kray fan will want the game and even more incredible for him to add : `` Neither Reg or Ron would ever condone crime . ''
     [java] 
     [java] HOW daft of producer Verity Lambert to talk of developing Eldorado 's storyline by axing six of the stars .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Daft of me not to be able to remember who the girl was , '' he said , `` but I tell you what I do remember .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Invention is a `` quick and sagacious penetration into the true essence of all the objects of our contemplation '' , and `` Judgment '' is `` the discernment of differences '' therein .
     [java] 
     [java] First , the discernment of what are legitimate purposes , and what are relevant considerations , within particular cases can never be value-free .
     [java] 
     [java] The answers that his analysis might produce were not intended for the enlightenment of participants but for the enlightenment of anthropologists .
     [java] 
     [java] It is the story of the failures of one generation written for the enlightenment of a subsequent generation .
     [java] 
     [java] '' It was very foolish of me . ''
     [java] 
     [java] That would be very foolish of you . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` Singularly foolish of Mother to leave it lying around . ''
     [java] 
     [java] That is foolish of him , because we have discovered that there is agreement more or less across the spectrum .
     [java] 
     [java] The smug foolishness of the Western leaders was typified by the British participants .
     [java] 
     [java] I have taken my children to the battlefields of north-east France as a result of which their grandfather died because of the foolishness of politicians .
     [java] 
     [java] If it was idiotic of the BP jury to make the award to such an obviously vested interest , it seems even odder that Mr Whittam-Smith , who places such store on journalistic integrity , should have seen fit to accept it .
     [java] 
     [java] It may be ill-advised of a young woman dressed in a titillating manner to accept lifts from a stranger , just as it would be foolish for the owner of an expensive motor car to leave his vehicle parked overnight in an ill-lit side-street .
     [java] 
     [java] I think it was quite intelligent of you , my dear . ''
     [java] 
     [java] According to the most naive of inductivists , the basis of scientific knowledge is provided by observations made by an unprejudiced and unbiased observer .
     [java] 
     [java] How perceptive of her to realize that the entity might thrive on violent opposition .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Very perceptive of you . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He thought that was very perceptive of her .
     [java] 
     [java] `` And it was very perceptive of you .
     [java] 
     [java] `` How perceptive of you , cara .
     [java] 
     [java] How reasonable of him to admit that Scotland is , as it always was , a separate and distinct nation .
     [java] 
     [java] Very sensible of Hilda : nothing is more ridiculous than an old-age pensioner gabbling on about his or her risque past .

     [java] 
     [java] Because of this pedigree , the opinions of the Left and of liberals have shied away from examination of the issue of morality in relation to crime .
     [java] 
     [java] If all science were as Lendrem portrays it , we could ascertain everything by resort to introspection and examination of our own motives .
     [java]

     [java] What was self-evident from even a casual perusal of the book was how extensively the unreconciled Dominion had influenced the others .
     [java] 
     [java] A chance perusal of The Peasant and Sinn Fein journals led her to enter Sinn Fein politics in 1908 .
     [java] 
     [java] A perusal of the Regulations suggests that the summary will be a pretty lengthy one and expressed in equally impenetrable accountants ' and lawyers ' jargon .
     [java] 
     [java] It was originally written in Hebrew , and therefore not for the perusal of the Gentiles .
     [java] 
     [java] Careful perusal of the records of the interviews suggests that , as with the meetings with the Head of Department , preconceptions were very influential .
     [java] 
     [java] The scrutiny of a presidential candidate 's private life never used to be so intense .
     [java] 
     [java] It was her inevitable fate that an imperfect marriage and the relentless scrutiny of the modern royals would fray away the mantle of the Fairytale Princess .
     [java] 
     [java] Thus there was no House of Commons scrutiny of public expenditure and virtually no understanding of how the decisions had been reached .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Who knows , '' she murmured , `` what a thorough scrutiny of your books might have revealed ?
     [java] 
     [java] It 's important as a hostess that you conduct a thorough search of your guests ' cars for malt whisky , smoked salmon and interesting cheeses before you let them undo their seat-belts .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] A thorough search of the Sea Rover revealed only the charred remnants of what was later analysed as cannabis , blowing around the decks .
     [java] 
     [java] After that we made a thorough search of the chapel , its walls , flagstones and altar , but there was nothing .
     [java] 
     [java] Today they seized drugs and goods and made a detailed search of the area .

     [java] A computer salesperson may carry out a survey of customer requirements prior to suggesting an appropriate computer system .
     [java] 
     [java] Theirs was a dialogue of the deaf , the producer voicing his intellectual doubts , the politician offering nothing but dogmatic certainties .
     [java] 
     [java] Revealingly , government representatives at a recent meeting of gypsy leaders from 14 Central and East European countries at a palace on Lake Snagov were mainly immigration officials .
     [java] 
     [java] MEMBERS of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg , the Welsh Language Society , began a vigil outside a meeting of the Welsh Language Education Committee ( PDAG ) yesterday .

     [java] 
     [java] To that of justification by faith he added the corollary that good works were a necessary expression of thanksgiving on the part of a Christian for unmerited justification by a merciful God .

     [java] Said by a husband to a wife in the middle of the night it might function as an expression of worry .
     [java] 
     [java] Idealist philosophers saw the human body as the most perfect expression of the vertebrate form .
     [java] 
     [java] The first law of thermodynamics is no more than one expression of the law of conservation of energy .
     [java] 
     [java] But Hilton is always careful to stress that the cleansing process to eradicate sin involves patient inner effort ( the expression of the anchoress 's fixed intention to God ) not violent physical punishment ( chapters 72--5 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] It is intensely personal , but again one can detect in it mechanisms used to control the feeling and turn it from a mere discharge of personal feeling into a genuine expression of emotion .
     [java] 
     [java] Moreover , a clear idea of the processes involved is essential for the formulation of a truly beneficial therapy .
     [java] 
     [java] While many language tests are relatively quick and easy to use , they do not generate the quality of information desirable for diagnostic statements or the formulation of remedial intervention strategies ( see Chapter 9 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Although Karl Marx 's formulation of the theory of surplus value was more sophisticated , his debt to Hodgskin is unmistakable .
     [java] 
     [java] Hence , too , the formulation of theories that the intelligentsia forms the new ruling class in technocratic , collectivized societies ( Lane 1982 , pp. 141-4 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] But it is the wording of the new contracts which appears to have prompted the strike .
     [java] 
     [java] Again the wording of the stories is either identical or very similar ( for example , compare Matthew 3:7-10 ; Luke 3:7-9 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] He said : `` Clearly we are very upset to hear of the death of a patient .
     [java] 
     [java] But on hearing of the find , the Archbishop immediately put forward the case that the original contract of sale of the Palace had not included furnishings , so the tapestries were the property of the Church .

     [java] 
     [java] `` Where are you going ? '' he inquired of Camille .
     [java] 
     [java] More top brass ? '' he inquired of the policeman standing over us as he wrote down our names and addresses .
     [java] 
     [java] One officer came up to inquire of our purpose , while the other kept at a respectable distance hand on his holstered gun !

     [java] Two years served and four to go because one in the chain had not owned the strength to withstand the interrogation of the KGB questioners in Lubyanka .
     [java] 
     [java] Interrogations of German prisoners-of-war captured in 1944 and 1945 on the western Front also revealed surprisingly high rates of continued trust in the Fuhrer , almost down to the very end of the war .
     [java] 
     [java] However , except in some cases of serious or organised crime , prosecutors leave the interrogation of the suspect to the police .
     [java] 
     [java] Legal rules govern important aspects of the process of gathering evidence , such as the interrogation of suspects .
     [java] 
     [java] This is achieved by debates and the questioning of ministers and in committees .
     [java] 
     [java] The progressive questioning of the staff made for a terrible atmosphere in the Staff Common Room .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Are you the social worker ? '' she demanded of David .
     [java] 
     [java] Joseph demanded of her : `` Who is this ?
     [java] 
     [java] The riposte of Mr Mohamed Al Fayed himself was intriguing.
     [java] 
     [java] The Sandinista campaign slogan, ``Everything will get better '', seems in this context an admission of defeat .
     [java] 
     [java] The payments would be made ``without admission of fault or liability ''.
     [java] 
     [java] It seems to be an admission of failure and weakness , especially when others are coping perfectly well with what appear to be even greater strains.
     [java] 
     [java] He calls prayer ``a longing of the soul '' and ``an admission of one's weakness ''.
     [java] 
     [java] For an actor, admission of homosexuality was tantamount to professional suicide, so it was necessary for Clift to hide the fact that he fell in love with men.
     [java] 
     [java] Openness in discussion, the acceptance of the searching question and the admission of uncertainty are all signs of the process of change proceeding at an appropriate rate for the individuals concerned '' (Briault and West 1990:20).
     [java] 
     [java] And the audience responded with a soft wave of laughter, approving his modest admission of fallibility .
     [java] 
     [java] Sharon's face lights up as she hears his admission of love .
     [java] 
     [java] With Profumo's admission of guilt , all the swelling tide of scorn and resentment for age, tradition and authority, all the poisonous fantasy of limitless corruption and decay into which it had ripened, were finally unleashed in their full fury.
     [java] 
     [java] Relations improved with South Korea as a result of concessions over the treatment of the Korean minority within Japan, and Japan's admission of guilt over its past treatment of Korea .
     [java] 
     [java] Environmental groups welcomed the Bank's admission of past errors , but criticized the report's faith in current models of economic growth.
     [java] 
     [java] In the early 1970s more and more allegations of cohabitation were being investigated , and more women were being deprived of benefit on these grounds .

     [java] 
     [java] The announcement of their sentences -- seven and eight years respectively - has precipitated a series of clashes between students and members of the security forces, who were said to have used bayonets.
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Washington was startled by the 2am White House announcement of the visit to Beijing by the National Security Adviser, Admiral Brent Scowcroft, and the Deputy Secretary of State, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger .
     [java] 
     [java] But when no announcements of conclusive victory emerged in the following few weeks, people began -- as was reported towards the end of October -- to express their impatience that the struggle for Stalingrad was taking too long and costing too many lives.
     [java] 
     [java] The announcement of her engagement to a man her parents hadn't even met had caused a storm.
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Novell is holding off announcement of a general release date until later in the year.
     [java] 
     [java] She had been amazed to find that he wasn't married, and waited painfully for the announcement of an engagement, or a sizzling scandalous affair .
     [java] 
     [java] Despite this assertion of confidence in the judiciary , there must be some doubt as to whether the law as it has evolved is in the best interests of the victim .
     [java] 
     [java] The speech consisted of little more than bullish assertions of the underlying dynamism and strength of the British economy .
     [java] 
     [java] Farman has claimed that the assertion of the chemical industry that its activities would only contribute 1 per cent to the green-house effect over the next 120 years are '' seriously underestimated '' .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I have little faith in the unsubstantiated assertions of psychologists , '' Briant said dryly .
     [java] 
     [java] A major assertion of democratic theory is that governments in representative democracies are uniquely sensitive to the preferences of the population .
     [java] 
     [java] With recognition of the language came the assertion of separate national identity .
     [java] 
     [java] She accepted it as a convenience, like an improved system of telephones; she did not dedicate herself to it as the expression of a moral idea of comradeship and equality, the avowal of which could leave nothing the same.
     [java] 
     [java] Although overt proclamations of the need to maintain English as a '' manly '' educational pursuit by no means disappeared during the inter-war period, the pages of the Review reveal few of the defensive and often hysterical avowals of the discipline's '' manliness '' that had been characteristic of the earlier period.
     [java] 
     [java] Defeat in five of the last six presidential elections had convinced some Democrats that fresh ideas were needed, while others call for a more forceful and enthusiastic avowal of liberal policies .
     [java] 
     [java] Ah, how touching, one might think, what a sensitive gesture, what a decent avowal of a perfection that leaves nothing more to be said .
     [java] 
     [java] The great boast of the German bureaucracy was encapsulated in Mayer 's dictum : `` Constitutional law comes and goes : administrative law stays the same '' ( Verfassungsrecht vergeht ; Verwaltungsrecht besteht ) .
     [java] 
     [java] That is the boast of a firm of Darlington solicitors which this week chalked up 100 years in business in the town .
     [java] 
     [java] However , the boast of British literary artistic freedom can not be made with confidence , given a vague law and a swinging moral pendulum .
     [java] 
     [java] Women currently aged 45 to 59 said they 'd only had 2.6 lovers , while men the same age boasted of 13.6 girlfriends .
     [java] 
     [java] She has boasted of her tendency to draw analogies between running the economy and a housewife 's weekly budget ( which many economists dismiss as pre-Keynesian , naive , and dangerous ) .
     [java] 
     [java] A glimpse in the mirror , or the well-meant comments of an old family friend , may remind us that we are growing to look like our parents .
     [java] 
     [java] Seldom has a team been so fired up prior to a major match , due largely to the pompous comments of Tipperary manager Babs Keating , who should have known better .

     [java] 
     [java] The basic contention of their paper was that if Britain did not dominate an area , the Russians would .
     [java] 
     [java] What I wish to discuss then is the contention of some in recent years that `` Jesus was a feminist '' .
     [java] 
     [java] It is not restricted , as in ordinary litigation which are proceedings between parties , to accepting or rejecting the respective contentions of the claimant on the one hand and the adjudication officer on the other .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The main contention of the appellant in this House and in the Court of Appeal was that Mr. Occhi had consented to the taking of the $6 and that , consequently , his conviction could not stand .
     [java] 
     [java] On its second day , the conference 's declaration of its sovereignty in making executive decisions on the country 's future political system was followed by a walk-out by government delegates .
     [java] 
     [java] The Slovak National Council approved a declaration of sovereignty on July 17 , shortly before Vaclav Havel , leading advocate of a continued federation , announced his resignation as federal President with effect from July 20 .
     [java] 
     [java] Many organisations do have a corporate mission statement which is a declaration of the company 's `` reason for being '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Lithuania 's deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas said the Republic was not prepared to suspend its declaration of independence , although it would negotiate on laws passed since , which have angered the Kremlin .
     [java] 
     [java] Denials of CIA involvement rang hollow in Washington , where the extent of the President 's obsession with ousting General Noriega is common knowledge .
     [java] 
     [java] Belief in God can be eroded from two opposite directions -- from the effort to prove God 's existence on the one hand , and from the denial of any evidence for God 's existence on the other .
     [java] 
     [java] He suppressed an exclamation of pain .
     [java] 
     [java] This news was greeted with smiles and exclamations of approval .
     [java] 
     [java] Meredith uttered an exclamation of disgust .
     [java] 
     [java] For once , her imagination had failed her , stifled by the chorus of predictable questions , the exclamations of wonder and admiration , the admonitions of anxious parents to over-venturesome children .
     [java] 
     [java] The muffled exclamations of horror continued , accompanied by the sounds of another bar being removed and the rattle of a key .
     [java] 
     [java] She made contact and heard an exclamation of pain and then her arms were pinioned behind her and she was powerless .
     [java] 
     [java] The important words this weekend will not be the public proclamations of East Germany 's `` inalienable place in the socialist community '' .
     [java] 
     [java] It is both a celebration of salvation and also a proclamation of God 's continuing gift of saving grace for his faithful people .
     [java] 
     [java] They can be of great service in transmitting the Faith , even though they can never replace the personal witness which is essential to the proclamation of the full truth and value of the Christian message .
     [java] 
     [java] Thoughtful pagans regarded the ethical demand of the Christian proclamation as too tough to be practicable , and feared that the proclamation of peace and love to enemies would make the empire pusillanimous in self-defence .
     [java] 
     [java] The way in which the conventional family depends on heterosexual relationships , for example , has inspired the open proclamation of the desirability of homosexual households .
     [java] 
     [java] Recent initiatives like primary nursing and the pronouncements of the Royal College of Nursing ( 1989 ) take this trend further .
     [java] 
     [java] For the disciples round the cross the words were the pronouncement of doom : the end of hope and meaning , the extinction of faith , defeat .
     [java] 
     [java] Four weeks after the pronouncement of the excommunication , Adolf was solemnly deposed in the cathedral of Cologne in the presence of Otto .
     [java] 
     [java] Again and again these feminist lexicographers refuse and indeed poke fun at the authoritative pronouncements of mainstream lexicography .
     [java] 
     [java] That my parents were continually making anti-Catholic remarks and pouring scorn on some of the more devotional pronouncements of the nuns did not help matters .
     [java] 
     [java] This idea , that private property and exploitation are just two sides of the same coin , is a central proposition of Marxist theory and is clearly expressed here .
     [java] 
     [java] Every novice student learns the elementary propositions of welfare economics .
     [java] 
     [java] The moral of this simple reflection is that fundamental propositions of science can be and often are causal , despite generality and mathematical form .
     [java] 
     [java] Because I have such regard for the right hon. Gentleman , it makes me all the more discontented to disagree with him about the proposition of permanent or automatic timetables .
     [java] 
     [java] The more that de Man can encourage the illusion of unmediated congress between reader and text , the less obliged he is to formulate potentially alienating propositions of his own .
     [java] 
     [java] At the weekend the Unionist Party leader , Jim Molyneaux , said the proposition of talks being started again was ruled out until Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution are revoked and amended .
     [java] 
     [java] The basic propositions of monetarism stem from the revival of the quantity theory of money , in particular by Milton Friedman , as described in Chapter 21 .
     [java] 
     [java] I remember on numerous occasions , when I entered an adult conversation at the table with a remark of my own , he would ask , `` Did anyone ask for your opinion ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] The remarks of officials and newspaper correspondents provide detailed information about the crime .
     [java] 
     [java] Two famous remarks of his mark out the dimensions of the question .
     [java] 
     [java] I agree with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough about the international entrenching of minority rights .
     [java] 
     [java] The revelation of Germany 's economic vulnerability governed Hitler 's thought .
     [java] 
     [java] An injunction was once granted in Duchess of Argyll v Duke of Argyll ( 1967 ) CH 302 to prevent the revelation of marital confidences .
     [java] 
     [java] But revelations of new scandals involving the Socialist Party continued , unabated , throughout the 11 months of his administration .
     [java] 
     [java] It was not her father 's revelation of an affair that surprised her .
     [java] 
     [java] Maritime historians rate his revelations of seafaring conditions highly .
     [java] 
     [java] For when I speak of the community being faithful to its own principles I do not mean its conventional or popular morality , the beliefs and convictions of most citizens .
     [java] 
     [java] There are innumerable passages in both the Jewish and Christian scriptures which speak of the ineffable greatness and holiness of God .
     [java] 
     [java] `` He speaks highly of you , '' she said .
     [java] 
     [java] For Margaret Thatcher they were a simple statement of her position .
     [java] 
     [java] The writer of the research report will want to draw together his results into a short statement of findings , which will probably be verbal rather than numerical at this stage, and where some sub-hypotheses have been substantiated and others negated the problem is not an easy one.
     [java] 
     [java] This is correct as a statement of fact , but not as an analysis of the logic behind their success.
     [java] 
     [java] This is not a complete statement of what in fact happened .
     [java] 
     [java] That is supported by the statements of the mother and D.'s foster mother .
     [java] 
     [java] The introduction should be a statement of intent .
     [java]

     [java] The whole place had an odour of long-gone take-away curries and engine oil .
     [java] 
     [java] The perception of Israel as an anti-Soviet bastion has persisted .
     [java] 
     [java] The Waitrose champagne is of the `` 83 vintage ; it has a glorious style of its own , light yet biscuity , classy with the muted perfume of hollyhocks and it makes a superb apertif .
     [java] 
     [java] He believed that the perfume of plants held magical forces and plant spirits whose power would help him concoct the elixir of life .
     [java] 
     [java] Then the emotional consideration : hear the coo of the dove for example , or smell the perfume of a rose , bask in the warmth of the Sun .
     [java] 
     [java] As the wicks burned , a strong perfume of sandalwood came from them .
     [java] 
     [java] A cloud of steam arose , the perfume of coffee .
     [java] 
     [java] Athelstan smelt the fragrance of the pine logs burning in the hearth , mixing with sandalwood , resin , and something more fragrant -- the heavy perfume of Lady Isabella .
     [java] 
     [java] Miller piles on the earnestness , and then piles on some more , with not only dialogue but devices that reek of awkward purity -- an unmotivated confession and a letter kept secret for years .
     [java] 
     [java] The reek of ordure voided from all his clothing .
     [java] 
     [java] All were shabby ; all had about them the cleanliness of icy well-water , spoiled and fetid with the reek of the city , that nothing but fire could dispel .
     [java] 
     [java] He liked the smooth-featured , sharp-eyed man , despite the reek of sweat and exertion .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a powerful reek of ammoniates and incense , with gusts of sour wine and sour flesh .
     [java] 
     [java] Wooden-wheeled ox carts trundled through the dense throng and the air was heavy with the pungent reek of salted fish , oriental teas and spices .
     [java] 
     [java] Everywhere there was a reek of something acrid that made their eyes smart .
     [java] 
     [java] People were blowing on their bowls of broth and mingling its savours of onions and mutton with the harsh fire of the whisky .
     [java] 
     [java] About everything he writes hangs a faint savour of calculation .
     [java] 
     [java] On some coals drawn to the side of the neat little fire , strips of meat were laid to grill : with the subtle savour of wood smoke they spread a most provocative smell on the still air .
     [java] 
     [java] She lounges through the party rooms , a scent of snow as she passes .
     [java] 
     [java] The scent of tobacco was wafted up the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] A strong scent of wine and onions wafted up from him : a tart , sickly smell that mixed with the heavy mustiness of the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Through the open windows of the room came the rich scent of summer flowers .
     [java] 
     [java] Hours later she woke to the same sensation of calm fulfilment .
     [java] 
     [java] I get an uncomfortable sensation of intrusion .
     [java] 
     [java] Soft music flooded through her helmet , and if she ignored the sensation of movement , she could almost pretend she was sitting at home almost .
     [java] 
     [java] She tightened her hand on his , and they sat holding hands for half a minute before Peter Yeo caught sight of his watch .
     [java] 
     [java] But I suppose I 'm prejudiced by my first sight of her , a passion-killer if ever there was one .
     [java] 
     [java] Haunted by visions of death , each finds purpose , desire and a horrible end within sight of the treasure .
     [java] 
     [java] Soon pieces of meat were being roasted right around the fire , and the air was thick with the smell of charred flesh and singeing fur .
     [java] 
     [java] She enjoyed the quiet gloom of the shippon , the sweet smell of hay , and the cows themselves , gentle creatures except for the sometimes awkward Primrose .
     [java] 
     [java] The priest had gone , but he had left the smell of scented oils behind him .
     [java] 
     [java] The woman 's face twitches like a tramp 's to the smell of soup .
     [java] 
     [java] If we rely upon the sound of a word when attempting to spell , then errors will range from the gross '' autograph '' outergraff '' to the more subtle '' honest '' '' onist '' .
     [java] 
     [java] She had always been given the most unpleasant tasks to perform , punished when she rebelled , as often she did , growing up without knowledge of love or hearing the sound of a kind word .
     [java] 
     [java] From far away , in the depths of the castle , came the faint sound of music .
     [java] 
     [java] The second submarine was being attacked now , but all the time the sound of combat was drifting further away .
     [java] 
     [java] There was no Tom to come in making a mess on the clean floor with his dirty boots , no sound of happy laughter round the table .
     [java] 
     [java] I asked him again , shouting to make myself heard above the grumble of thunder and the sound of water .
     [java] 
     [java] Standing on the landing , the sound of Terry 's tearful voice floated up to them .
     [java] 
     [java] Sometimes he 'd come back , bringing a stink of the badlands .
     [java] 
     [java] I am struck by small objects and my nostrils fill with the stink of rot .
     [java] 
     [java] We rolled into Casma just after three in the morning , the stink of fish oil hanging over the port and an old adobe fort peering at us out of mist .
     [java] 
     [java] The flames leaped up , with an overpowering stink of burning cheese .
     [java] 
     [java] Next to the incessant bombardment , the stink of putrefaction and the utter desolation of the battlefield , Verdun combatants testify again and again to the terrifying isolation , seldom experienced to the same degree in other sectors .
     [java] 
     [java] My brother just dislikes the taste of meat and is faintly surprised that other people do not .
     [java] 
     [java] Each salmon remembers the precise taste of the waters in which it hatched , a flavour derived from the mix of minerals in its mud and the plants and animals that live in it .
     [java] 
     [java] It was the taste of death in his mouth that preoccupied him .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Ja '' , he whispered , as she caressed his corded neck with her open mouth , overwhelmed by the scent and taste of his heated , sweat-dampened skin .
     [java] 
     [java] Nevertheless , there is in the air at Blackpool a first whiff of post-Thatcher .
     [java] 
     [java] After almost three years of backing Modigliani 's work , Zborowski scented the first whiff of success in the spring of 1919 .
     [java] 
     [java] Haslemere also scents a whiff of dishonour in the reluctance of errant ministers to resign .
     [java] 
     [java] If he had been , he 'd have moved away double quick because the slightest whiff of orange triggers off his migraine .
     [java] 
     [java] His gigs are guaranteed to bring a whiff of the student union bar into any auditorium ; full of lager , lavatory jokes , thwarted sexuality , and tinged with aggrieved politics and environmental concern .
     [java] 
     [java] John Wesley died in 1791 , aged eighty-eight , and the famous mutiny of the British Navy ship Bounty took place .

     [java] No uprising of deaf and dumb people ever took place , as the government wisely ignored this particular proposal of the Royal Commission .
     [java] 
     [java] To retain its hegemonic dominance it criminalised the inner city uprisings of disenchanted youth , marginalised the youth of the black communities and removed trade-union struggles from the field of civil law to the arena of public disorder .

     [java] 
     [java] This is quite appropriate because he is the Emperor of Turkey , and a mighty one at that .

     [java] The intensely religious former viceroy of India and wartime ambassador to Washington has had a bad write-up .
     [java] 
     [java] His position will be incomparably less grand than that of the last Viceroy of India , and his achievement is almost certain to be less satisfactory .
     [java] 
     [java] After a few years , the Earl settled down to a more responsible way of life as a serious politician , Rector of Glasgow University , Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire and Viceroy of Ireland .
     [java]

     [java] Being Irish herself , and the sister of a man who had gone mad with syphilis , she was rather more tolerant of Warnie 's foibles than he was of hers .
     [java] 
     [java] If only we humans were less ambitious , and more tolerant of one another , then there would n't be a need for arms at all , and every mother 's child would be safe .

     [java] In political terms , the grants to Buckingham can be partially justified by the need to replace the council of the prince of Wales which , apart from the attack on its Woodville members , had lost its focus with the accession of Edward V. But the scale of the grants leaves no doubt that the primary aim was the aggrandizement of Buckingham .
     [java] 
     [java] Even so , the propaganda which set out to promote the aggrandizement of the figure of Franco , almost to the point of beatification , could not have succeeded without fertile ground in which to plant its seeds .
     [java] 
     [java] Technological advances , international competition and consequent relative price reductions in producer and consumer electronics have led the US , European and Japanese TNCs , that for the most part control the electronic media , to develop global strategies for the establishment and aggrandisement of their various hegemonic practices that would have been technically impossible , and in some cases even unthinkable a few decades ago ( see Schiller , 1981 ; McPhail , 1987 ) .

     [java] Enamel thickening of the molars and enlargement of the premolars seem likely to be linked to a dietary change in the afropithecin fossils .

     [java] 
     [java] As is the case with its farming and defence policies , the current budgetary arrangements of the EEC simply could not survive a substantial enlargement of the Community .

     [java] One Sunday , he went hunting with his fierce black mastiffs , stopping only to swig at a flask of strong drink .
     [java] 
     [java] Even as she spoke she was taking a fleecy rose-coloured towel out of the linen press , turning on the water , unscrewing a flask of bath essence which perfumed the rising steam .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It is like a glass of dirty water .

     [java] He nodded politely to Wakelate and took the glass of brandy with a crooked little finger .
     [java] 
     [java] The glass of wine chilled Sara 's hand , she listened to the sharp-ended sentences flicking through the air as her husband and Nicholas spoke .
     [java] 
     [java] She turned away abruptly and snatched up a glass of champagne as a waiter passed by with a tray of brimming glasses .
     [java] 
     [java] Specimen jar of sea water in hand , she cheerfully highlighted the embarrassing prospect of European Court prosecutions over the pollution of nearby pleasure beaches .

     [java] Abberley 's with piles of cigarettes , note pads , lawyer 's folders , photographs , a torch , pencils , jar of caramels .
     [java] 
     [java] A tin of shortbread , a box of chocolates and a jar of chicken breasts in aspic had seemed suitable .
     [java] 
     [java] Robyn unscrewed a jar of moisturiser and smoothed it over her face and neck .
     [java] 
     [java] It was later traced by police to the locker of club skipper Cyril Proby .
     [java] 
     [java] I looked at Taff sitting opposite me in the gloom , his hands wrapped around his hot mug of tea , his shoulders hunched forward .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Cheers , Pat , '' I said raising my mug of brandy .
     [java] 
     [java] Armed with the yellow pages and a mug of coffee , I settled down by the telephone .
     [java] 
     [java] He is sitting at our camp now , holding a mug of our tea , relaxing on a canvas chair .
     [java] 
     [java] It would help to know in what way precisely he maligned people , but the child remained as mum as a mute , one hand gripped tightly into a fist , the other holding the mug of cocoa .
     [java] 
     [java] Suzie comes into the room with a mug of hot chocolate .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , when the rice and meat were ready , Mina fetched some pots of river-water from the big copper container in the corner and everyone washed their hands where they were sitting round the fire .
     [java] 
     [java] A reservoir of coloured gel is put near the nozzle .
     [java] 
     [java] Why did n't they wait for the passengers to get off first , instead of squeezing themselves , their sacks of wheat and bicycles on at the same time that others were dragging their possessions off ?
     [java] 
     [java] He turned away to the bedside table and found a souvenir sack of nickels from Las Vegas among the things he had unpacked from his pockets .
     [java] 
     [java] They had met a fortnight after Meg 's arrival when Alice had called at the Old Rectory with a suitcase of jumble for the annual sale in aid of St Andrew 's Church in Lydsett .

     [java] She purchases three tins of dog food at 46p each and a box of Miaow Krunchies at 96p .
     [java] 
     [java] It was hot and thickly sweet from a new tin of condensed milk .
     [java] 
     [java] Underneath the sink he found a large tin of rat poison .
     [java] 
     [java] He snapped shut a file on his desk , reached for his briefcase and extracted the small tin of vaseline .
     [java] 
     [java] They stole 24 tins of baked beans worth $4.14 .

     [java] Mrs Parkin described how children were coming to the school weighed down with tins of food .

     [java] 
     [java] This study was carried out to compare the serum concentrations of laminin in patients with cirrhosis with comprehensive clinical and laboratory tests in each patient to identify the factors associated with the increase of this glycoprotein .

     [java] Birkenhead MP Frank Field has taken up the fight of Tranmere residents who feared they were in danger of becoming a `` forgotten area . ''
     [java] 
     [java] When the case came to court , the magistrate evidently decided that it was impossible to say which party was to blame in a scuffle of this sort .
     [java] 
     [java] Under the surface of an everyday conversation a duel of two astute minds was taking place .
     [java] 
     [java] As the war moved towards amphibious invasions and a clash of continental armies , the Commandos ' numbers increased but there were proportionately fewer involved in small-scale raids .
     [java] 
     [java] But in France , as in Germany , anticlericalism inflamed a confrontation of Church and State at many points , from educational policy to marriage laws , and was to finish in disestablishment .
     [java] 
     [java] Part and parcel of both was his confrontation of the USSR on all fronts , but especially in the arms race .
     [java] 
     [java] He had stayed long enough to see the first stage of the counter-inflation policy accepted and the clash and confrontation of two years earlier replaced by a new partnership .
     [java] 
     [java] Politically- or socially-conscious artists chose themes which revealed society 's shortcomings : Lawrence devoted his life to portraying the oppressed lives of his race , Fougeron focused on the political and material struggles of the working class .
     [java] 
     [java] In the prosecution of the war , the Left discovered far greater opportunities for political advance than any that had arisen from the anti-war struggles of the 1930s .
     [java] 
     [java] Many have been killed in the political struggles of South America and in the missionary work in Africa , and many are still persecuted in many communist countries .
     [java] 
     [java] Although the VP remained the dominant force in Vanuatu , the party was unable to regain the authority which it had lost during the leadership struggle of 1988 [ see p. 36381 ] .
     [java] 
     [java] The battles and skirmishes of middle-class rural boundary disputing are of interest only to their panting protagonists .
     [java] 
     [java] She felt pleased -- not wanting to have anything to do with the squabbles of these upper-class money-grubbers .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It is largely made up of the petty squabbles of shop-keepers and the airy superiority of the ironmasters . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It took the military stalemate of 1915 to persuade the UDC that the time was ripe to talk about peace without victory .
     [java] 
     [java] The Birth of Athena there is certainly a peaceful subject , opposed to the strife of two deities in the west , but it is a scene of activity and there is much movement in the treatment .
     [java] 
     [java] Elle Folk are great thieves of dough and other food , and are strange-looking indeed .
     [java] 
     [java] They go to England , where Eric Claptout , the legendary thief of the blue dilithium crystals , says that Johnson was a top geezer .
     [java] 
     [java] George Walker , former chief executive of Brent Walker , was arrested and charged with the theft of 2.5m from the company .

     [java] 
     [java] You do have some control over the costs in the form of wage bills so you may require information about that area , and your daily cash takings and some idea of stock turnover to control for pilferage of goods or cash .
     [java] 
     [java] The one they took him for in the end , she was eighty-five years old , and ailing , and he robbed her of her life-savings , and that was less than three hundred pounds .
     [java] 
     [java] I think the robbers of tombs had a lot of courage .
     [java] 
     [java] A SFWP statement responded : `` Companies engaged in the robbery of our mineral and oil wealth should stop interfering with our democratic system in the hope of increasing their political influence '' .
     [java] 
     [java] The music comes to vivid life under Jarvi 's direction , as it does in the sometimes surprising but always purposeful fluctuations of tempo in the first movement .
     [java] 
     [java] These problems were never entirely overcome and fluctuations of enthusiasm in the use of the economic boycott/free-produce tactic depended on temporary external factors rather than permanent solutions to the difficulties .
     [java] 
     [java] As Woodforde noted the cost of everything he purchased , we can follow the fluctuation of prices .
     [java] 
     [java] But developing countries are still dependent for all their foreign currency earnings upon the fluctuations of commodity prices on the world market .
     [java] 
     [java] Grace met Herbert through Major Chaplin Court Treatt , the husband of her sister Stella .
     [java] 
     [java] John , husband of the Wear Valley Council chairman , also recalls that the area round the pub was once known as Brickyard .

     [java] Members will be very sad to hear that John Hewitt , husband of our secretary , Hilda , has died .
     [java] 
     [java] The wife of the commissioning client was a woman for whom chastity was perhaps the foremost virtue in her repertoire .
     [java] 
     [java] One `` very satisfied '' housewife is Sandra Bishop , the twenty-three-year-old wife of a painter and decorator , an ex-factory machinist and the mother of one daughter aged eighteen months .
     [java] 
     [java] Opposite my house on Bronnaya Street there used to live the remarkable actress Alice Koonen , the wife of Taev , and she and I were very fond of each other and got on very well together .
     [java] 
     [java] And at last , Clare felt nothing but love for this passionate , loving wife of his .
     [java] 
     [java] The wife of the chief coiner however , being tipped off about the search had the stack of coins , the moulds and other equipment thrown into Rusland Pool . ''
     [java] 
     [java] In 1847-8 Queen Adelaide , widow of William IV , visited Madeira on her doctor 's advice .
     [java] 
     [java] As they square up to each other the spouses of the first three men `` Enter above '' and implore them not to fight .
     [java] 
     [java] The ambivalence lies in the representation of the Goddess as either alone or as the spouse of a male God .
     [java] 
     [java] An authoritative source avers that his inamorata , Ms Mandy Smith , the former spouse of Mr William Wyman , is not in sufficiently robust form to `` make love '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr X and the spouse of Mr X may be excluded from all benefit .
     [java] 
     [java] However , if he goes to post , Speedy Boy ( a stable companion of Namoos ) will be the one to beat .

     [java] The companions of invalids explored the island on foot , on horseback and in hammocks and palanquins .
     [java] 
     [java] As sympathetic companion of the suffering god , the satyr embodied man 's highest and most intense emotions .
     [java] 
     [java] If becoming a person can only arise through communion with God , then in the same way the marriage of two persons arises and is sustained only in God .
     [java] 
     [java] She does not mention the break-up of the marriages of Diana and Charles or Andrew and Fergie directly .
     [java] 
     [java] Single White Female star JENNIFER JASON LEIGH once dated ERIC STOLTZ , the current boyfriend of BRIDGIT FONDA , who is Ms Leigh 's room-mate in SWF .
     [java] 
     [java] `` And of course that drippy boyfriend of hers backed her up . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The boyfriends of the girls made up the numbers .
     [java] 
     [java] CHESHIRE housewife Tamara Kennerley , a girlfriend of Clinton when he was at Oxford , was among the first to offer her congratulations .
     [java] 
     [java] Lane Bodine ( Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ) , former lover of arms dealer Rourke , appears to be making her loot as the go-between in the arms scam .
     [java] 
     [java] This group is led by Ms Jayalalitha , a former film star , and , more important , a former mistress of the late Chief Minister , Mr M.G. Ramachandran .
     [java] 
     [java] Couturiers and provision merchants , caterers and decorators never refused Lady Hamilton , mistress of Admiral Lord Nelson , all the credit she needed .
     [java] 
     [java] Campbell looks at the shoplifting of young females .
     [java] 
     [java] This follows a charge of shoplifting of an amount of meat from an Ayr superstore . ''
     [java] 
     [java] During the latter years the only minute of interest was in October 1869 when '' the secretary was empowered to write to Mr Menzies and Dr. Campbell , the former from taking any papers and the latter from entering the room altogether , not being a subscriber , '' In 1870 there was a complaint about the pilfering of papers and the committee have to acknowledge , with regret , that their attempts to prevent this evil have not been attended with such success as had been anticipated .
     [java] 
     [java] He was accused of illegal possession of firearms and of embezzlement of public funds .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1642 Winter 's grant was rescinded by a vote of the House of Commons , because of his misappropriation of timber in the forest .
     [java] 
     [java] Here the shareholder could argue that the insider dealing was either a mala fide abuse of position or a misappropriation of the company 's assets , neither of which are ratifiable .
     [java] 
     [java] But this pre-history he rejects serves as a symbolic equivalent of the narrative of multiple usurpations and misappropriations of territory that occupies the following six hundred pages .
     [java] 
     [java] Again , he is taken down by a very firm snatch of the lead .
     [java] 
     [java] The stealing of clothing is less understandable especially as the smellier the socks the more appetising to Holmes .
     [java] 
     [java] The most recent practice has been the stealing of seeds .
     [java] 
     [java] Armies of monks in blood-red robes hang around the place .
     [java] 
     [java] Big Arnie Schwarzenegger would probably prefer to tackle the Penguin than the army of infant terrors he faces in Kindergarten Cop .
     [java] 
     [java] It is at this stage that suddenly the chorus of advice dies away and the armies of theoreticians depart .
     [java] 
     [java] And what about the small army of Morland Place pensioners -- former employees , who all seemed to enjoy an extraordinary longevity , and who seemed to live in houses needing constant repair ?
     [java] 
     [java] Colonies of aphids can build up quickly on plants such as kalanchoe
     [java] 
     [java] His Superintendent asked for a priest to go to the island of Molokai where a colony of lepers lived in appalling conditions .
     [java] 
     [java] I walked further along the edge of the sea , and came to a point where the shore steepened into cliffs and there were large colonies of gulls nesting .
     [java] 
     [java] A single hill contains a colony of several million insects .
     [java] 
     [java] On the cliffs there are magnificent colonies of guillemots , razorbills , puffins , fulmars and kittiwakes and , offshore , gannets and shearwaters pass by even whales may add to the day 's impressive wildlife list .
     [java] 
     [java] The Brichardi have just bred for the first time and have a healthy brood of 20 or so fry .
     [java] 
     [java] It will be in the female 's best interests to lay just four eggs and rear all the young than to lay seven eggs and produce a brood of weaklings .
     [java] 
     [java] I noticed bunches and bunches of grain and seaweed , marguerites and long-stemmed buttercups drying in the pantry , for winter . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Yet she 'd walked right into this marvelous chance , with no mother who would get jealous of her with the baby , only this bunch of doctors to deal with .
     [java] 
     [java] One man was carrying a huge bunch of red bananas over one shoulder , another was driving a small open truck loaded with oranges .
     [java] 
     [java] His mother carried an enormous bunch of daffodils , wrapped in pale blue tissue paper , and Miranda clutched a new doll .
     [java] 
     [java] Trying to vamp a bunch of vagrant whales in the Pentland Firth in March armed only with a waterproof tannoy and a box of plain-wrapped tapes is not everyone 's idea of a good time .
     [java] 
     [java] This quiet group of people looked so simple and unassuming that at first he could not think what made them interesting to him , and then he realized that they gave every appearance of complete sincerity .
     [java] 
     [java] Most fax software lets you define a group of names in the fax phone book , and send them the same fax at the click of a button .
     [java] 
     [java] The private pilot , or group of pilots , gets down to some serious drinking and think about raising money .
     [java] 
     [java] There is a regular group of teachers who work in pairs with this class .
     [java] 
     [java] We passed a rural church , a country pub , and then turned down an unpaved cul-de-sac running through a dense cluster of beeches and pines to a four-square Edwardian villa with overhanging eaves and low-pitched roof .
     [java] 
     [java] Most importantly , there was a cluster of writers , directors , actors and critics who gathered around an idea of a realistic , passionate , intellectual theatre which would have been a most fertile ground for Burton .
     [java] 
     [java] They fire clusters of fungal spores , and each attack has a 10% chance of also liberating Red Mould into the area , so that characters are subjected to two attacks .
     [java] 
     [java] Fornax is always very low from European latitudes ; it contains an important cluster of galaxies , but all its members are below binocular range .
     [java] 
     [java] She looked disapprovingly at the cluster of purple flowers amid the handfuls of green-grey leaves .
     [java] 
     [java] They condemned the traditional slaughter of thousands of pilot whales by locals of the Faroes , a cluster of islands between Scotland and Iceland .
     [java] 
     [java] Victoria Chipeto , Zimbabwe 's Minister for Wildlife , yesterday defended her country 's intention to continue selling ivory by culling its herds of 52,000 elephants .
     [java] 
     [java] A herd of zebras , hence , produces about a quarter to a third of its weight in prey carcases per year .
     [java] 
     [java] He owned a savage wolfhound called Wolfhead and a herd of swine who roamed the forest and fields below Penhill .
     [java] 
     [java] Imagine great herds of long-horns -- perhaps three thousand head -- walking across that landscape north , to where there was plenty of money and an appetite for beef .
     [java] 
     [java] We saw herds of stags and although we never actually walked for a day when we did n't see anyone else , there was a week of walking when we only saw one other person for every day .
     [java] 
     [java] Little assembled a squad of 20 professionals , many on terms which would make Hartlepool blanch .
     [java] 
     [java] Now it has been rendered virtually obsolete by the introduction of quasi-military squads of police officers known as SWAT ( Special Weapons and Tactics ) units .
     [java] 
     [java] It is understood a special six-man squad of detectives is making its own inquiries after meeting a wall of silence generated by fear from the injured men and others seen so far .
     [java] 
     [java] A plant costs .25 , a bunch of flowers 95p and a pack of bulbs .89 .
     [java] 
     [java] These involve much more open and distance learning and the creation by photocopying and electrocopying , of `` customised '' packs of materials for students .
     [java] 
     [java] Jessamy prized her privacy far too much , she could n't bear to have a pack of journalists prying into every corner of her life .
     [java] 
     [java] The slim , perfectly manicured , fingers touched her face and hair like a swarm of honeybees exploring a bed of exotic flowers .
     [java] 
     [java] A second swarm of enemies attacked Arthur 's skin and he swore at them blue murder .
     [java] 
     [java] Such swarms are fed on by mysticete ( whalebone or baleen ) whales , and experienced whale hunters sought the swarms of krill in the expectation that whales would be seeking them too .
     [java] 
     [java] If you thought that seeds and cuttings were the only way to increase your garden plants then turn to the Gardeners ' Manual for a host of practical ideas to try .
     [java] 
     [java] The picturesque countryside , fantastic choice and family events , excellent shopping and the host of places to visit make Nottinghamshire the perfect short break destination .
     [java] 
     [java] And they were awarded a host of qualifications , from GCSE and `` A '' level to RSA , C , College Dip and BTEC , although non-examined courses absorbed the majority .
     [java] 
     [java] And with the Holy Father a prisoner and the Emperor in uncertain health , the situation of that little family must be arousing a host of eloquent prayers this minute .
     [java] 
     [java] A willow green wicker armchair takes on a whole new look when a collection of pretty floral covered cushions and a deep frill are added .
     [java] 
     [java] The new collection of totes C2000 sunglasses features stylish designs in tortoiseshell and black , which cut out the dangerous glare from the sun and provide protection from both UVA and UVB rays .
     [java] 
     [java] At the Irving Plaza , a gaggle of girls are wandering around conducting a poll .
     [java] 
     [java] So when the Deputy Public Prosecutor himself suddenly appeared in person the assembled newshounds reacted like a gaggle of novices witnessing an apparition of the Virgin Mary .
     [java] 
     [java] As tension at the count at Hummersknott School mounted , a worried gaggle of counters informed the Returning Officer the number of ballot papers did not tally with the number who had cast votes .
     [java] 
     [java] Unleashed by the deregulation of 1986 , building societies have spread their tentacles across the country and attracted a flock of satellite industries , especially in legal services , accountancy and financial consulting .
     [java] 
     [java] And then seagulls flew free , and a flock of sparrows , and they seemed to own the sky and not me .
     [java] 
     [java] He now runs a flock of 250 breeding ewes at Nant-y-Derw , Cwmbach , near Builth Wells , and is also involved in farm tourism .
     [java] 
     [java] They are still much the same in appearance as they were then , and farmed in much the same way , although tractors have now replaced teams of oxen .
     [java] 
     [java] The decision to `` expel '' the first batch of embassy refugees to the West was a `` humanitarian act '' done in the interests of the many children involved and to avoid epidemics .
     [java] 
     [java] Paulus delivered his large batch of suspects to Constantius .
     [java] 
     [java] The first batch of 50 units costs 10 per unit and the second batch of 50 identical units costs 20 per unit because of inflation .
     [java] 
     [java] It acted as a centralised design studio for all carpet factories in Russia , sending out infrequent batches of new designs , which only then would enable a manufacturer to change .
     [java] 
     [java] The last time I was walking by Loughshannagh , our party of three followed the tracks of a fox , clearly left in the snow , around the southern base of Doan to the lovely Ben Crom river .
     [java] 
     [java] For the historic gift was forwarded to Eric by former astronaut Col Bill Phailes , who flew a mission on the shuttle in 1985 and who was in a party of 24 Americans visiting Springfields .
     [java] 
     [java] We engage a party of girls in conversation on the subject , but they turn out to have no interest in football ( one is a Tottenham Hotspur supporter ) , and they leave hurriedly .
     [java] 
     [java] A king would not be an hereditary monarch , but would be elected from a small cohort of princely and chiefly families , in the ancient Irish manner .
     [java] 
     [java] To begin with , a middle-aged blonde woman jostled him but was quickly joined by a cohort of silver-haired reinforcements .
     [java] 
     [java] To compare seroconversion for HIV between drug users and homosexual men an additional control group of seroconverters for HIV-1 was selected from our cohort of homosexual men in Amsterdam , which has been extensively described .
     [java] 
     [java] Many of his peers seem uptight , all too conscious of the legions of photographers and TV cameras .
     [java] 
     [java] It would ( will ) take legions of staff to support the growing number of information resources in electronic form .
     [java] 
     [java] The report has warned the government to prepare for the '' wholesale contamination '' which is likely to ensue as legions of small-scale operators shut down and abandon their plants .
     [java] 
     [java] She was propped up now against a heap of pillows .
     [java] 
     [java] A large heap of peanuts belonged to her at this moment , and her natural liveliness was well to the fore .
     [java] 
     [java] Palafox and Romana are thus the first of a long succession of generals who claimed that the army officers embodied the general will of the nation , perverted by a selfish clique of unpopular politicians .
     [java] 
     [java] President : Saddam Hussein has dominated Iraqi politics since the late 1970s with a small clique of relatives and supporters from his home town of Takrit in northern Iraq .

     [java] 
     [java] The east frieze has a combat before Troy ( some painted names of heroes can still be read ) , and an assembly of gods no doubt disputing its outcome .
     [java] 
     [java] However , an assembly of spherulites would be acceptable , since it would contain sufficient to make it entirely typical of the bulk and because such an assembly would have moduli independent of the surface tractions and displacements .
     [java] 
     [java] The philosophy right from the start was the need to incorporate a variety of approaches , both analytical and intuitive .
     [java]

     [java] Longest wing here has a length of 7 cm .
     [java] 
     [java] That , of course , does n't take into account the initial upset caused by the dimensions of the neck , which is much more guitar-related , with a nut width of only 1i'' .
     [java] 
     [java] It will also narrow the width of the road , reducing vehicle speeds .
     [java] 
     [java] Wide Work , despite the richness and width of the vein -- 6 ft. and more in places -- was much the same as when the '' German '' miners had left it .

     [java] 
     [java] Instruments of torture feature somewhat incongruously alongside porcelain , glassware and fans owned by members of the imperial family .
     [java] 
     [java] In the past twenty years the planning , organization and equipment of order-maintenance has been steadily updated and centralized , so that the police now has the potential to mobilize thousands of riot-trained and equipped police officers .
     [java] 
     [java] He had none of the equipment of a detective , neither being particularly observant nor having any great insight into the psychology of small boys .

     [java] To prevent the starvation of the whole community , the following priorities were established .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] She was now a married woman or , rather , widow , ostensibly carrying the child of a man who had been killed in action .
     [java] 
     [java] The children of the rich may work in health food shops or other faddish and esoteric pursuits which utilize their educational experience and may provide a more acceptable form of class reproduction than simple inheritance .
     [java] 
     [java] John Aubrey [ q.v. ] states that Petty was related to Oliver Cromwell ; in fact the Pettys were connected by marriage with the Ingoldsbys and the Hampdens , who in turn were in-laws of the Cromwells .
     [java] 
     [java] The result is an adversarial but illuminating work which , though heavy going in places , should be compulsory reading for all students of English literature and all students of science .
     [java] 
     [java] The truth of the matter is that , conceptually , rhythm occupies that grey area of learning that few students of the guitar will admit to having any desire to explore .

     [java] Best-selling novelist , short story writer , occasional teacher of creative writing `` insofar as it can be taught '' .
     [java] 
     [java] As one might expect , teachers of Latin eloquence , too , soon became respectable .
     [java] 
     [java] Just because he is a professor of medicine at Cambridge does not make his findings unquestionable .
     [java]

     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Nor is there any likelihood of competition being diminished , except in the case of one minor product , titanium dioxide .
     [java] 
     [java] Not only is this likely to increase the likelihood of relevance of the information , it also enhances user commitment .
     [java] 
     [java] If she left early each morning and came home late at night there was very little likelihood of her meeting Leo .
     [java] 
     [java] Many SSDs are already looking to 1995 and the likelihood of no AIDS Support Grant funding .
     [java] 
     [java] I SHALL treasure my copy of Friday morning 's Times carrying the front-page headline `` Exit polls point to certainty of a hung parliament '' .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] U.S. authorities admit they are worried about the possibility of a repeat of the mass suicide in Guyana in 1978 when more than 900 followers of cult leader Jim Jones took cyanide .

     [java] 
     [java] Provision is to be made against specific debts which are beyond the normal due date for payment to the extent that the directors recognise the possibility of irrecoverability .
     [java] 
     [java] In a bound book there is less chance of anything being lost -- especially if you write in ink so that there can be no later alterations .
     [java] 
     [java] For an installation to be secure against fire , flood and other disasters it is essential for the primary and secondary items to be stored in different locations so that the chances of their simultaneous destruction are minimised .
     [java] 
     [java] Poor vulval conformation may benefit from Caslick 's operation ; a minor operation performed under local anaesthetic which lessens the chances of infection , and improves the chances of conception .
     [java] 
     [java] One calculation , offered by opponents of Darwin 's theory , is based on the improbability of an object as complex as a living organism arising by chance .
     [java] 
     [java] Must the existence of God be probable , or can theism seek to defend its position against the improbability of God 's existence ?
     [java] 
     [java] He acknowledged the great help and encouragement he received from Mr. John Owen , schoolmaster of Wroxeter free school ( not the famous Puritan of the same name ) .
     [java] 
     [java] The schoolmaster of St. Andrews was ambitious `` and aspires eagerly to the dignity of being professor of humanity in this university '' .
     [java] 
     [java] After her death , he married Margaret Ann , daughter of Angus McEwan , schoolmaster of Assynt ; they had two sons .
     [java] 
     [java] The mere question : were you once the schoolteacher of a small boy called Morenz and has he showed up ?
     [java] 
     [java] The probability of such an event may be low , but the consequences would be serious since investment income for long-term funds is approximately half as large as their total premium income .
     [java] 
     [java] Hence , the greater the volatility , the greater the chance , within any given term to expiry , that share price and option premiums will change , thus increasing the probability of a profitable investment .
     [java] 
     [java] Yet despite the amount of money generated in the region , it has remained largely impervious to the attempts of local companies to establish computer retail operations .
     [java] 
     [java] Certainly the size largest keiretsu have at their centre very influential banks , who in some cases , managed to deflect the attempts of the US Occupation to dismantle their organization .
     [java] 
     [java] Bazin had previously attracted strong criticism from US diplomats as being one of the most vociferous opponents of the diplomatic attempts of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) to restore Aristide to power .
     [java] 
     [java] For this reason alone , the introduction of Lates to Lake Victoria may soon be seen as one of the great biological disasters of the twentieth century .
     [java] 
     [java] Before leaving the city for ever , I came across a philosopher , Jean-Jacques Rousseau , even more noted than the family of my accursed Master .
     [java] 
     [java] Collective security , which had been understood as an alternative to the diplomacy discredited by the catastrophe of 1914 , became increasingly difficult to distinguish from the traditional pursuit of a balance of power in Europe .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] In Shklovsky 's view , Sterne 's Tristram Shandy consists of a series of violations of literary conventions which draw our attention to the forms of fiction ; in so doing it transforms formal questions into content .

     [java] Her problems in making sense of Hilary Roberts ' bumf had nothing to do with an inability to grasp the fundamentals of research methodology , but everything to do with want of enthusiasm .
     [java] 
     [java] The want of technique is compounded by the greater nervousness felt when facing out and surveying the whole sweep of exposure below .
     [java] 
     [java] Indeed , its very ordinariness and the want of any reliable documentation could easily have led to its disposal .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] He went out and Robertson heard the hooves of his garron clopping on the road .
     [java] 
     [java] But as they headed triumphantly home , a scree slid under the hooves of Muriella 's garron , which fell .
     [java] 
     [java] The very flexible hooves of the mountain goat give it maximum grip on precarious slopes and dizzy ledges .
     [java] 
     [java] I picked him off Newbury racecourse after he had broken most of his ribs under the flying hooves of his competitors .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It 's ointment , '' he lied , `` culled from the hoof of an elk and mixed with herbs .

     [java] A WOUNDED British woman told yesterday how her lover gave his own life to save her from death in the claws of a crazed grizzly bear .
     [java] 
     [java] I see the way the snow is kicked up off the paws of the dogs , the way their breath explodes around their heads .
     [java] 
     [java] By half past five he had drifted off to sleep underneath three paws of the other dog , which had taken to him .
     [java] 
     [java] And as rats are so abundant ( as many as 5000 may live in a pair 's range ) many will escape the talons of the nocturnal predators .
     [java] 
     [java] The thin pelts of hair ( phocid ) seals and denser pelts of fur seals probably afford better protection against wind-chill than against the cold of the sea ( Figure 6.5 ) .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] An awesome beast who figured in Egyptian legend , the Devourer sported the mane of a lion , the body of a hippopotamus and the jaws of a golden crocodile .
     [java] 
     [java] Surely he wore the mane of a lion upon his head and clutched in his upraised claws , the lifeless body of a small child !
     [java] 
     [java] This he had learnt from Ann herself , who had forecast the sex of both babies by means of a golden ring suspended by the longest whisker of a white cat .
     [java] 
     [java] Philips is describing ice which has formed on trees and plants , and even , a little further , on the antlers of a stag .

     [java] The head and antlers of the magnificent full grown male appeared on the skyline not fifty yards away .
     [java]

     [java] He rubbed the muzzle of a horse when it nosed up to him , and scratched its ears .
     [java] 
     [java] The beaks of flamingos are usually inverted when feeding , the algae and shrimps are filtered from the water by hair-like lamellae on the rims of the bill openings .
     [java] 
     [java] The characteristic gaudy beak of the puffin is but a summer adornment , and is shed in winter .

     [java] The eyes of predators are finely tuned to the slightest movement , but are less well equipped to distinguish static shapes , especially if their outlines are blurred by broken patterning or by foliage cover .
     [java] 
     [java] So on a cold dark night the body heat of warm-blooded animals interferes with the clarity of vision , but the eyes of a toad can still pierce the gloom .
     [java] 
     [java] Like the rest of the water-borne world , they can see parts of the spectrum invisible to the eyes of land creatures .
     [java] 
     [java] Apple 's own effort does not bode well for the clutch of Macintosh-on-Unix houses like Echo Logic Inc , Xcelerated Systems Inc and Quorum Software Systems Inc .

     [java] MDC external affairs director Bob Lane last night said the Private Finance Initiative enhanced the prospects of a clutch of development plans on Merseyside .
     [java] 
     [java] There to watch him were more than 200 invited guests , including textile designers , producers , analysts and journalists from America , Europe and Japan , and a clutch of local dignitaries .
     [java] 
     [java] This may in turn have caused the forelegs of prosauropods ( the Triassic forerunners of sauropods ) to become more massive , stimulated as they were by the repeated dropping onto all fours when moving slowly .
     [java] 
     [java] She kicked away the heavy limbs of the man who was sharing her bed , at the same time dislodging a grey cat from the bed 's foot .
     [java] 
     [java] The prominent patch of red on the flank of Scott 's Wrasse immediately takes the eye , but the entire body and fins of this species is beautifully coloured .
     [java] 
     [java] The newt 's legs , advanced though they are compared with the fin of a coelacanth or a mudskipper , are not very efficient .
     [java] 
     [java] The fins of these fish make ideal targets for `` fin rippers '' so be careful what other fish you introduce into the aquarium .
     [java] 
     [java] The warriors hurled themselves at the heads or horns of their animals to make them lie down .
     [java] 
     [java] '' Chuck and me just want you to know , Jacques , that we do n't aim to leave this jungle today without the hide and horns of the biggest bull seladang in all Asia .
     [java] 
     [java] He went across and stroked the nape of her neck , and she sniffed and stiffened and then relaxed .
     [java] 
     [java] Now the sun stroked Jasper 's back , laid a burning hand on the nape of his neck .
     [java] 
     [java] Into the nape of the neck of the youngest , who was lying on his stomach with part of his spine exposed , the flesh and muscle ripped away by the 9mm bullet .
     [java] 
     [java] One of the cheap cigars to which she was addicted burns ignored between her fingers , the skin of her face dragging down with indifference .
     [java] 
     [java] Because it was wearing the skin of her own lamb , and smelt the same , she would with luck think it was hers .
     [java] 
     [java] The liver must be in contact with the skin of the user , however , to be used .
     [java] 
     [java] Now for the first time he touched her skin , the skin of her forehead , with his fingertips .
     [java] 
     [java] ABOVE Part of a Kirlian photograph of the fingertip of a drug addict .
     [java] 
     [java] This is a consideration of principle rather than practical reality , since the relevant law is often obscure , and unlikely to be at the fingertips of the qualified lawyer let alone the layman .
     [java] 
     [java] A multiplicity of small early termini was replaced in 1914 by Tokyo Central , a station so vast as to vie with Howrah in Calcutta , though other mainline termini , Ueno and Shinjuku , survived .
     [java] 
     [java] Seeking to emulate him in every way , he decided he too would have a multiplicity of spouses .
     [java] 
     [java] However , the multiplicity of parameters that can be recorded on a DFDR system have substantially eliminated the need to use complicated methods for extracting useful information from flight recorders .
     [java] 
     [java] A community reveals itself gradually through a multiplicity of voices .
     [java] 
     [java] A second feature which characterises German Romanesque churches is the dramatic skyline pattern created by the multiplicity of towers , cupolas and turrets .
     [java] 
     [java] Jurnet could see his lips -- the red , perpetually moist lips of an old man -- moving , hear the inarticulate hum of what he was saying .
     [java] 
     [java] Ordinary treatment may generally include the type of less intrusive , less expensive care we call preventive treatment .
     [java] 
     [java] Your midwife or GP will be able to tell you about the types of care available which may include : a hospital maternity unit , a GP maternity unit , or a home birth .
     [java] 
     [java] This type of union resembles the free intercirculation union in terms of the currency competition associated with it .
     [java] 
     [java] their enthusiasm is still that of a child who asks all kinds of fascinating questions about the new world in which he finds himself .
     [java] 
     [java] The brown-haired boy had caught the eyes of the twins again and was desperately attempting to relay some kind of message to them .
     [java] 
     [java] After some periods of discouragement , attempts to put things right and make the effort needed to achieve the kinds of adjustment required for mutual happiness are often postponed , then shelved .

     [java] Clearly they were not the sort of married couple that was used to communicating by letter , and when they did it was only rarely that anything illuminating was said .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] She breakfasted on fried bread and bacon , and tea with four spoons of sugar , before a full turkey dinner with the other 33 residents at her nursing home in Redcar , Cleveland .
     [java] 
     [java] Beat 100g/4oz vegetarian Stilton with 25g/1oz softened butter , one tablespoon of port , one finely chopped pear and one teaspoon of snipped chives .

     [java] Slowly she wandered back into the kitchen and started to unpack the boxful of food .
     [java] 
     [java] Asik became angry as he thought of all the people in his village who could have been saved by the fruit in the lorry which had just passed him , throwing up bucketfuls of dust into his face .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's not a sum you 'd throw away ; but you 'd be happy if it bought a new handbag , a train fare to London or a tankful of petrol .
     [java] 
     [java] A tankful of petrol would n't come amiss .
     [java] 
     [java] The arrival of each vendor is greeted by the crowd rather as the appearance of a man with a sackful of rice would be greeted in a Kurdish refugee camp in midwinter .

     [java] 
     [java] Dr Roy Brown estimates that 12,000 hectares of moorland in the North York Moors National Park is not grazed intensively enough because farmers are reducing sheep flocks .
     [java] 
     [java] Tree saplings ( over 1 metre in height ) are absent from 80% , by area , of the 5,400 hectares of broadleaved woodland in the Snowdonia National Park , virtually all of which is LFA .
     [java] 
     [java] More than 11,000 rabbits have been killed in the 12 months since the Shetlands council introduced the scheme , which is estimated to have saved acres of grass , cabbages and turnips .

     [java] 
     [java] His marriage to Aethelburh gave him a connection with cross-Channel diplomacy and his children by Aethelburh were kinsfolk of a Mer ovingian king in Gaul .
     [java] 
     [java] The Angevin connection was thus represented by a close kinswoman of Edward I. Jean of Brittany 's talents were more suited to diplomacy than to warfare ( although he served against Philip the Fair in Aquitaine , between 1294 and 1297 ) , while his close connections with both the French court and the nobility of western France clearly helped to ease tension at periods of crisis .
     [java] 
     [java] Despite Alcuin 's reservations about Eardwulf , the king must have stepped into the shoes of the slain Aethelred as a recipient of Carolingian favours and may even have married a kinswoman of Charlemagne .

     [java] In March parents and relatives of Italy 's 17,000 missionaries made a pilgrimage to Rome .

     [java] 
     [java] In early April the excitement built up as the first shoals of mackerel were expected .
     [java] 
     [java] What you must beware of , however , is using all your bait on a massive shoal of small barbel .
     [java] 
     [java] It is only the second time this century that a school of sperm whales has been seen in the waters around Orkney .
     [java] 
     [java] The best crops of arabica beans are grown at altitudes of between 2,500 and 6,000ft .
     [java] 
     [java] To shorten the odds on reproducing itself it must produce a significant crop of attractive fruit , but it can not do this without the framework on which to hang and parade its wares .
     [java] 
     [java] Nouvel has not yet sunk foundations into British soil , but his work on his home turf in France has produced a crop of prize-winning designs and an endless stream of commissions .
     [java] 
     [java] A farmer has turned the clock back fifty years to harvest his crop of wheat .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Males take territories here and attract temporary harems of females on to them .
     [java] 
     [java] He shrugged and then flung open the door wide enough to accommodate a harem of estranged wives .
     [java] 
     [java] These deer tend to form large herds , and during the breeding season males defend large harems of females .
     [java] 
     [java] This C.rubriventralis is a male which , in the wild , will maintain a harem of females .
     [java] 
     [java] We know male deer develop enormous antler at vast cost to themselves to dominate harems of females , but not all male deer do that .
     [java] 
     [java] You play Ripley , who has to despatch hordes of alien-infested humans from an underground penal colony .
     [java] 
     [java] We kept putting food out , though , and after about a month they all suddenly returned , with hordes of hungry ducklings in tow .
     [java] 
     [java] There are gas masks , ration books , lots of soldiers , sailors and airmen and hordes of pretty girls , plus some ladies dressed just as I remember my own mother and Auntie Ethel !
     [java] 
     [java] There they found their beloved girl , surrounded by a horde of chimpanzees that had found and taken care of her .
     [java] 
     [java] A stand of rosebay willow-herb ( Epilobium angustifolium ) , for example , with its striking tall spikes of pink flowers looks attractive for at most four months of the year .
     [java] 
     [java] Sharpe gave the mare a last despairing hack with his heels , then ducked his head as she crashed through a stand of ferns and thus into the wood 's cool margin .
     [java] 
     [java] This helps to improve your repertoire of shots and development and understanding of spin .
     [java] 
     [java] They trailed 20-7 at half-time as Harlequins ran through their repertoire of slick back-line moves in preparation for their Cup final showdown with Bath .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] I replied that for better -- or worse -- we were taking a posse of his pupils to the Alps .
     [java] 
     [java] The posse of television trucks obscured the view for many , but Schumacher had been careful to ensure that his speaker system would at least enable them to hear if not to see .
     [java] 
     [java] Meredith 's mouth was open beneath her mask as Lucenzo imperiously led her to a favoured seat , followed by a posse of attentive waiters .
     [java] 
     [java] The hostages were `` this hurdle '' , `` this obstacle lying in the road '' , a dark huddle of rags in the foreground of a vista of peace .
     [java] 
     [java] A huddle of passengers gathered round the steps of the carriage to get a look at the reading and , lest their breathing distort the figure , Nadia held it aloft like a fish between finger and thumb .
     [java] 
     [java] First and foremost was the rise in the price of oil and its products which provoked both more efficient usage and switching to other , cheaper fuels .
     [java] 
     [java] For the record , Mayflower Manners is available from Doubleday at the relatively light price of $14.95 .
     [java] 
     [java] The recent collapse in the producer price of Brazil nuts has threatening implications for swathes of the Amazon forest , since local people whose livelihoods depend on gathering the nuts may be forced to resort to slash-and-burn agriculture .

     [java] 
     [java] This expresses the willingness of buyers of bills to hold the existing stock .
     [java] 
     [java] Though the tenor part was originally missing , it has been faithfully restored by analogy with the motet to make a glorious addition to the recorded repertory of Tallis 's music .
     [java] 
     [java] If our planet has seen some eighty billion people , it is difficult to suppose that every individual has had his or her own repertory of gestures .
     [java] 
     [java] Thus we have a varied and respectable repertory of urinals , rags , earth , pipes , plastic , neon tubes and bedpans .
     [java] 
     [java] And added to that , in the future -- should you progress in your apprenticeship -- it will provide you with a repertory of useful explanations .
     [java] 
     [java] A labour market can be defined as the area in which buyers and sellers of labour services come into contact with one another .

     [java] 
     [java] In this extreme case , the tax would be paid by the producer or seller of whisky .
     [java] 
     [java] The buyer of the contract has made 100 profit which he receives from the seller of the contract .
     [java] 
     [java] The seller of an option contract , or option writer , has a set of possible returns which is the exact opposite of that of the buyer of the contract .
     [java] 
     [java] Transom Trading is a retailer of motor spares and accessories .
     [java] 
     [java] Manufacturers and retailers of the handheld games disagree .
     [java] 
     [java] In response to the buoyant demand for GUIs almost all vendors of computer systems now offer such an interface product .
     [java] 
     [java] Vendors of fruit , gingerbreads , ale and hot potatoes did a roaring trade , as did the pickpockets , albeit in a quieter fashion .
     [java] 
     [java] Can I please , through your letters page , make a request on behalf of all vendors of second-hand equipment ?
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The problem with this type of promotion is that it undermines any sensible perception which purchasers of children 's books might have of what constitutes value for money .
     [java] 
     [java] There must be a delivery to the subsequent purchaser of the goods or documents of title .
     [java] 
     [java] A cloak of velvet , a mask of silk , the dim candlelight , suddenly these things seemed too flimsy for disguise , and the little package felt as large and heavy as a case lined with lead .
     [java] 
     [java] Aunt Margaret sat on a bank of primroses , naked but for a cloak of brilliant green loosely slung around her shoulders .
     [java] 
     [java] Finn dancing in his stained vest and Francie playing the fiddle like the devil himself , who had been a fiddler , and the dumb aunt in a cape of fiery hair whistling along a flute .
     [java] 
     [java] The wardrobe had provided her with a vest of padded cotton , but for some reason she would n't wear it .
     [java] 
     [java] She produced a smile of pure triumph .
     [java] 
     [java] Diana 's smile of delight is truly radiant .

     [java] 
     [java] Universities and colleges are looking to expand their intakes , but are drawing on a shrinking population of 18-year-olds .
     [java] 
     [java] Rather , I see the population of plants trapped in narrowly constrained evolved ruts , bearing the battered imprint of recent and not-so-recent selective and other forces .
     [java] 
     [java] Such studies do not give a true reflection of population needs , nor may the clinical indices used to predict survival or estimates of prognosis be applicable in the wider population of patients with severe acute renal failure .
     [java] 
     [java] It was here that Aenarion 's sacred armour was forged , along with enough swords and suits of armour to outfit an army .
     [java] 
     [java] The only idea that seemed feasible was for the Collector to put on the rusty suit of armour which stood in the banqueting hall and to go out there with a scythe .
     [java] 
     [java] Not bothering to conceal a smirk of satisfaction , he announced , `` We 're going to have to let the bugger go . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Withel 's snarl of triumph died in his throat .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The torches blazed upon tall tasselled banners , and lit robes of white and scarlet and gold , borne by men with innocent faces .
     [java] 
     [java] We came on to the dirt road and a woman in a fluttering robe of pale pink organza walked towards us .
     [java] 
     [java] The strike resulted from a crackdown by the Turkish authorities on the smuggling of Iraqi oil by lorry through Kurdistan to Turkey .
     [java] 
     [java] Shortages were exacerbated by the smuggling of petrol to neighbouring Benin , Cameroon , Chad and Niger as well as by local hoarding .
     [java] 
     [java] An appeal has been launched for government officials to improve their understanding of the importance of preserving nature , and to enforce local restrictions on the poaching , purchasing and smuggling of wildlife .
     [java] 
     [java] The beautiful three-piece suits which dominated his collection combinations of a narrow shouldered jacket with a cropped waistcoat and lean , cuffed trouser -- clearly evoked the attire of every well-dressed Edwardian gentleman .
     [java] 
     [java] Stocky , well-fed merchants walked arm-in-arm with their plump wives , clad in garments of silk and satin , decorated with miniature pearls of exquisite delicacy .

     [java] 
     [java] Crystal chandeliers glittered brightly above a marble floor ; a quartet of musicians played music -- real music , Nicolo thought , incongruously , not the brain-frying stuff they 'd played during the fashion show .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Just the job , '' thought the enthusiastic Gary , and thus became the first person in history to attempt to convert a quartet of Jehovah 's Witness .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] A trio of grumpy officers , all Pinochet look-alikes , demanded our passports , eyeing us curiously lest we be Argentine spies .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] A trio of geese paddled past .

     [java] For a moment , she said nothing , but sat watching him pour out a mug of beer ; then she said bitterly , `` You 're an ungrateful devil .
     [java] 
     [java] Endless afternoon teas when we discussed giving mugs of hot chocolate to needy children at Christmas time or whose turn it was to do the flowers in the Maternity Hospital .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Got some hold over him she has , I swear , '' Gwyneth continued , taking the mug of wine her mother handed her .
     [java] 
     [java] It may not go with a tableful of curry , but a mug of cold beer is not what I need .
     [java] 
     [java] The celebration of each child 's birthday in school can involve other ideas than `` how old am I ? '' which is explored in chapter 11 The Passage of Time .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Many of the Patrons of the Campaign were present , including the Duchess of Beaufort , Sir John Wills , Dr Bob Woodward and Dr Derek Zutshi .
     [java] 
     [java] The Duchess of York has launched a new nationwide charity scheme to encourage mentally disabled artists .
     [java] 
     [java] All thoughts of Seal Sands Lock were stashed away , safe from the mockery of people like Gazzer .
     [java] 
     [java] Many men wore cushions under their shirts or put on grass skirts and false breasts , whether in emulation or mockery of the gentler sex .
     [java] 
     [java] The mockery of such spirits would seem to us today to be capable of attracting their spiteful revenge .
     [java] 
     [java] The mockery of his companions is unabated .

     [java] 
     [java] I thought I was doing what I , and I alone , wanted to do , but my pursuit of academic superiority shows that I was still striving to be the person my parents wanted me to be .

     [java] Throughout 1935 Vivien continued her lonely pursuit of her husband .

     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] During the final five minutes of this sequence a period of intense activity was obvious and coincided with the emptying of water from the stomach and duodenal bulb .
     [java] 
     [java] Another official visitor was Barend du Plessis , the Finance Minister , while Helen Suzman , the best known of all the critics of the system in South Africa , met the Prime Minister a week ago .

     [java] There are many critics of psychoanalysis .
     [java] 
     [java] Critics of the charter had reportedly expressed fears that the opposition 's allegiance to the monarchy would reduce pressure for further democratization .
     [java] 
     [java] In so far as the interview is a critique of Thatcherism -- and that is not as far as might have been supposed from the headlines in yesterday 's papers -- it is misplaced .
     [java] 
     [java] His critique of the alternative is more convincing than his defence of the status quo .
     [java] 
     [java] Anti-authoritarian leftism and the critique of bureaucratic socialism had of course been well established before the foundation of the SI in 1957 .
     [java] 
     [java] In this respect , Romanyshyn 's work is a rich extension of Edmund Husserl 's critique of psychologism , the reduction of experience to its subjective aspect .
     [java] 
     [java] Rowland -- with his paranoiac hatred of the music press , his fervent work ethic , his privileging of `` projected passion '' over intellect -- turned soul into a kind of micro-fascism .
     [java] 
     [java] In particular , her hatred of her body and her description of her breasts as `` useless lumps of flesh '' echo the feelings of other girls I spoke to about the female body .
     [java] 
     [java] They were close , even though there were times when Edward found it hard going , when he could n't excise his hatred of Nancy from his mind .
     [java] 
     [java] Joseph Hyde said Ireland had taken too much from her , but was that enough to account for her hatred of the country ?
     [java] 
     [java] Their hatred of exploitation and their knowledge of western capitalism and the socialist movement it had brought into being led them to utopian socialist illusions .
     [java] 
     [java] I ran a fragrant bath through muslin bags of mint and lavender and flung my clothes onto a chair eager to get in .
     [java] 
     [java] Above him hung a cellophane bag of yellowy liquid , a tube carrying that vital plasma into his arm , somewhere below the lower extent of his field of vision .
     [java] 
     [java] He also handed him his bag of tools and said , `` You 'll be wanting these , before you go . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I drank two of their barrels of wine , and was still thirsty , because that was only half a litre .
     [java] 
     [java] He skirted the heaps of chippings and barrels of tar left by the workmen repairing the paths .
     [java] 
     [java] The tanker , which was carrying nearly 2 million barrels of light crude from Oman to Japan , caught fire and began gushing oil from its damaged hull .
     [java] 
     [java] The eight-man team train by hauling a barrel of concrete up a telegraph pole using a pulley system -- and then digging in and holding the 810 kilo load aloft for up to half an hour .
     [java] 
     [java] The barrels of sodium hypochlorite , which is used to clean beer bottles , fell onto the side of the A 40 at Witney in Oxfordshire .

     [java] 
     [java] Tiny baskets of cherries are tucked away in the display , an idea popular in Victorian times .
     [java] 
     [java] I have seen poultry and rabbits and large baskets of butter and eggs sharing seats down to Barnard Castle .
     [java] 
     [java] The dealers snatch the baskets of produce they have bought and rush them to waiting lorries .
     [java] 
     [java] They lugged the baskets of laundry upstairs together to the lingerie .
     [java] 
     [java] Surely it could not take this long to gather up a few baskets of food ?
     [java] 
     [java] At the same time he gave alms with his own hand to the poor from a basket of coins placed by his side .
     [java] 
     [java] Most charge a fixed fee for a basic service and , say , $1.35 for each extra bin of rubbish .
     [java] 
     [java] Two small bottles of pills stood by his plate at the first evening meal , and naturally excited the professional interest of his uncle .
     [java] 
     [java] The almost empty bottle of Scotch was in keeping with Moore , and so was one glass .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a boy there of my own age and we got drunk together at the far end of a room with a bottle of martini .
     [java] 
     [java] The bottle of champagne took five attempts to break , the roses dropped , out of the two passing aircraft , missed the ceremony by 200 yards and the balloons drifted off downwind , unnoticed .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a half bottle of Pinot Gris .
     [java] 
     [java] The centre-piece of the dining-room table was a bowl of electric light bulbs .
     [java] 
     [java] Golden bowls of blood stand on a table within the circle .
     [java] 
     [java] Zurachina was in the next room ; Burun could hear her ordering the slaves to unpack the boxes of bed linen .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Dyson was stocking up with sacks of flour and sugar and boxes of dried fruit , and the shelves high on the walls of the shop carried forty-eight pound jars of jam and mincemeat .
     [java] 
     [java] Police in Kent are investigating the discovery of a briefcase of Army training material found dumped outside the Intelligence Corps at Ashford .
     [java] 
     [java] He was armed with an archaeological book he had dug out of that bulging briefcase of his and was on his hands and knees sifting through a pile of discarded bones . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Her owner rushed to bring her a bucket of oats before she should become entangled in the fence once again .
     [java] 
     [java] Buckets of beer circulate to encourage the men ( the pubs are open all day ) and the atmosphere is quite convivial by now .
     [java] 
     [java] The woman did n't remove her arms from the curd , only nodded at her son and then at the bucket of peelings .
     [java] 
     [java] He was an English King , and his great rival was France , and , in order to taunt King Henry , the Dauphin of France sent him a bucket of tennis balls . ''
     [java] 
     [java] When six cartons of drugs , bandages and serums were heaped on my study floor there was the business of finding out when and how they should be administered .
     [java] 
     [java] I got no machines initially , but did receive a huge carton of magazines and books .
     [java] 
     [java] They 'd all got off the bus together ; this one had gone into a truckers '' cafe for cigarettes and a carton of coffee .
     [java] 
     [java] Looking further ahead , Mr Garnett has made provision for using refillable plastic cartridges of chemical with his device .
     [java] 
     [java] They had claimed containers of worms found in their car had been dug in an unprotected area elsewhere and that they had stopped at the bay to gather mussels .
     [java] 
     [java] The practice is dubious anyway as larger containers of detergent can become contaminated by certain bacteria , often pseudomonads , and act as reservoirs of infection or spoilage .
     [java] 
     [java] There was more gunfire , and containers of sugar and ketchup jumped to pieces on tabletops .
     [java] 
     [java] Rice and crates of soft drinks survived the capsize and a system was rigged up to collect rainwater .
     [java] 
     [java] Crates of fruit and vegetables were stacked at the other end .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Ward brought a hamper filled with oranges , apples , bananas and lettuce ; her husband Freddy staggered under the weight of a crate of lemonade .
     [java] 
     [java] But with the help of Renfrew High School , 14 crates of books , pens and other equipment , including a computer , are being sent out to the African school .
     [java] 
     [java] Abbot Kenneth was holding a cup of medicine to the old man 's lips , but Eachuinn Odhar pushed it away and turned , eyes hooded , to face his son .
     [java] 
     [java] Picking up her cup of cocoa , Rosie said , `` It was just an idea .
     [java] 
     [java] She pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner , and the cylinders of oxygen in the back pack lying beside it .
     [java] 
     [java] Danielle Maillefer of the World Health Organisation reported that 100 cylinders of oxygen , needed during operations , had reached the city .
     [java] 
     [java] Some of the damage was done by the thousands of casks of rum which were stored in the town , and which exploded in the heat and caught fire immediately .
     [java] 
     [java] Her engagement present was hardly internationalist or fashionable : two dead fish , six casks of sake , some silk for a kimono .
     [java] 
     [java] In Bailiffs of Dunwich v. Sterry , the plaintiffs had the right to wrecks at Dunwich and the defendant took a cask of whisky from a wreck before the plaintiffs could get it .
     [java] 
     [java] Balor grinned at Snodgrass and smacked his lips and grabbed the cask of mead and thought that had n't the Humans strange , mimsing appetites to be sure .
     [java] 
     [java] Drums of powdered milk and dried egg were kept there , and sometimes the walls were hung with dead rabbits and the flagged floor littered with bloody skins .
     [java] 
     [java] Above our heads a huge drum of paper , some twenty feet wide , was slowly tracking along on a conveyor .
     [java] 
     [java] It would be able to accommodate 150,000 drums of radiocative material accumulated in Taiwan since 1979 , as well as low-level waste produced by both governments for the next three years .
     [java] 
     [java] The stout landlord , who had been down in the cellar fetching a fresh keg of ale , lowered it to the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Four kegs of Heller , five of Dunkler .
     [java] 
     [java] New Zealand has another Irish pub -- and it sold over 50 kegs of Guinness in its first three weeks , well ahead of any other beer it stocks .
     [java] 
     [java] There 's enough explosive power in a really big display to make the twenty kegs of powder Guy Fawkes planted below the Houses of Parliament look like a damp roman candle .
     [java] 
     [java] However , this line of argument is hardly what radical analysts of the welfare state should want .
     [java] 
     [java] Laying my pack of cigarettes on the table , I lay back on the bed and looked at the ceiling .
     [java] 
     [java] Moving to the sideboard , she picked up a pack of Chesterfields and lit one with trembling hands .
     [java] 
     [java] The post offered , that of general inspector of tobaccos , was a good one , and the intended recipient , Deacon Murray , was well pleased , although he declined to accept .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1896 he was appointed chief inspector of factories and workshops , the first medical man to hold this position .
     [java] 
     [java] Dr David Walker , Chief Inspector of Historic Buildings , has been appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Such a middle-class way of carrying on , '' she thought , and remembered how Gabriel and she had revelled in roast beef and two veg , and concocted casseroles of liver and sausages and baked beans .
     [java] 
     [java] Unmould each casserole of pimiento on the centre of a large plate .
     [java] 
     [java] . Few things now call forth less collective compassion of humankind than the great suffering animals endure in the name of human interests . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` The compassion of Mrs Lodge is something this court can not ignore , '' said the judge .
     [java] 
     [java] Selected by MaryAnn Stevens , the Academy 's Librarian and Head of Education , and Christopher Lloyd , Surveyor of the Queen 's Pictures , it comprises seventy-one pictures , but no pastels nor drawings .
     [java] 
     [java] The Surveyor of the Fabric has looked at the tell-tales and thinks we will have to do some work on the pinnacle , which is n't too big a job at all . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Counselling may reveal turmoil and bring it to the surface , but if it does , that turmoil will have existed long before the commencement of the counselling process .
     [java] 
     [java] If the developer has not sought planning permission prior to the commencement of work and has started work which requires planning permission , he or she may be served by the local planning authority with an enforcement notice .
     [java] 
     [java] The commencement of a daily Qantas service to Australia via the Far East and Gulf Air 's start on the Abu Dhabi routes bodes well for the future , '' said Manchester Airport chief executive , Gil Thompson .
     [java] 
     [java] Yet the folder of poems makes clear that there was a group of women poets associated with Weston Hall .
     [java] 
     [java] The Director of Studies then produced a folder of his son 's Art ( from another school ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Davis checked that each man had a rucksack of bombs , a pocketful of fuses , benzedrine tablets , a full water-bottle and a loaded weapon .
     [java] 
     [java] There were spices -- a small cloth pouch of cumin and a bigger one of turmeric .
     [java] 
     [java] In a moment or two , when she 'd recovered , she produced her chillim and the little pouch of tobacco that she kept in her waistband .
     [java] 
     [java] He knew that she carried a pouch of poisons .
     [java] 
     [java] She was led away into a crisp-looking cell where she was measured and weighed ; a careful , polite pair of hands found a vein in her strong arm and removed a vial of her blood .
     [java] 
     [java] As a final touch , you might like to place a vase of fresh flowers in the room ; this will greatly enhance the atmosphere .
     [java] 
     [java] She stood near a great vase of dried grasses and leaves and her dress was something flowery .
     [java] 
     [java] A vase of white lilies stands on the table ; the decanter is a silvered jug of water only .
     [java] 
     [java] Elinor read the cards from two identical large vases of lilies which took up all the space on the dressing table .
     [java] 
     [java] The next moment Ronni was being led inside , into a huge tiled entrance hall with a round central table weighed down by an enormous vase of fresh flowers .
     [java] 
     [java] A croissant warm from the oven , a cup of good coffee and a tumbler of just-squeezed orange juice costs under $1 .
     [java] 
     [java] Because you lost so much body water in the heat , small boys brought tumblers of iced water at the end of every set .
     [java] 
     [java] JOHN SMITH peered into the vat of red lipstick and chortled at its name .
     [java] 
     [java] The men loaded parts onto a system of fixtures and controlled the fixtures as they dipped the parts into vats of different solutions .
     [java] 
     [java] Soon he surfaces from a vat of hot tar , covered from head to foot ; the `` tar '' was really food flavouring .
     [java] 
     [java] An urn of Waimea sand , representing the ashes of the dead man , was voided on the sea .
     [java] 
     [java] Ronni was surprised he remembered that conversation by the urn of red geraniums .
     [java] 
     [java] Hooks of meat , barrows of vegetables , trays of pies , urns of tea passed him in every direction .
     [java] 
     [java] But look out for hidden extras : most operators will charge a preparation fee of around $30 for airport transfers and installation of toilet chemicals and a starter tank of propane gas .
     [java] 
     [java] On collection of the car , clients paying cash will normally be asked to pay a further deposit roughly equivalent to the remaining cost of the rental and the full tank of petrol .
     [java] 
     [java] You have a full tank of petrol and some reserve supplies at the back .
     [java] 
     [java] In the late spring , the colourful male builds a nest of seaweed and entices a ripe female to lay her eggs in it .
     [java] 
     [java] Shortages of cash to pay soldiers and sailors , insufficiency of crews , and the slow assembly of retinues to be shipped across the sea often combined to delay ships assembled at ports of concentration .
     [java] 
     [java] Two possible approaches to the assembly of the components into mechanism trains have been investigated .
     [java] 
     [java] The actual construction of a carpet goes a long way to determining how long it will keep its original appearance .
     [java] 
     [java] The construction of a cross-Channel link was discussed exhaustively in the early 1980s before the proposal for a joint British/French rail tunnel was finally approved in 1986 .
     [java] 
     [java] Suppose the government spends an additional $100 million on the construction of a new motorway .
     [java] 
     [java] He 's also sceptical about the construction of a gas-fired power station at Staythorpe .
     [java] 
     [java] Hers the first sip of pink champagne .
     [java] 
     [java] She reached for a sip of water .
     [java] 
     [java] He cleansed his palate with a sip of iced water , then flooded it with the crisp , light taste of Veuve Clicquot .
     [java] 
     [java] Carey could n't tell what had been said ; the words were spoken far back in Ellwood 's throat and seemed to gush from his mouth and nose like a great gulp of water swallowed too hastily .
     [java] 
     [java] Riven downed a great gulp of the cold beer and felt it alternately chill and warm his gullet .
     [java] 
     [java] She snatched a gulp of her drink and banged the glass on her teeth .
     [java] 
     [java] For these women it seems to have been a breath of pure oxygen , heady with proposals for socialist-feminist action , at a time when Kinnockism is attempting to kill it off .
     [java] 
     [java] The landing was deserted , but the stench of blood was as strong as ever .
     [java] 
     [java] And again there was that sickly sweet stench of cooked flesh which clogged his nostrils and made him want to vomit .
     [java] 
     [java] The stench of blood and waste sickened him .
     [java] 
     [java] The odour of fried bacon surrounded him , and a dirty plate and cutlery , pushed to the corner of the table , showed that Albert had just finished his evening meal .
     [java] 
     [java] It is pitch black round the clock and everyone is depressed , drunk and stinks of fish oil .
     [java] 
     [java] Restaurant boss Torbjorn Olsson , who sells the stuff in Soho , London , said : `` When they get home , their breath stinks of garlic not beer .
     [java] 
     [java] She crept down toward the stink of blood .
     [java] 
     [java] The flames leaped up , with an overpowering stink of burning cheese .
     [java] 
     [java] If you can not afford saffron , use turmeric , but you will miss the delicate fragrance of the Spanish spice .
     [java] 
     [java] The odour of seaweed wafted from the cliffs beyond the harbour and mingled with the fragrance of Jo 's cigar .
     [java] 
     [java] His dark suit was impeccable , his hair was exactly the right length , and the fragrance of his aftershave was just sufficiently elusive as to be almost unbearably tantalising .
     [java] 
     [java] The brilliance of the blue and gold morning , the fragrance of fresh-ground coffee , the tranquil pool and bewitching glimpse of blue sea beyond -- it was all in marked contrast to her bleak mood .
     [java] 
     [java] It is extremely important that the client must learn that avoidance of difficult situations is never an appropriate solution for their anxiety .
     [java] 
     [java] This avoidance of conflict became the key to the much-vaunted `` harmony '' of the Japanese social system .
     [java] 
     [java] Thus the very foundations of NEP were steeped in economic obscurities , loose interpretations , and plain evasion of coded principles .
     [java] 
     [java] Through a clever about-turn , the evasion of responsibility is concealed .
     [java] 
     [java] Facts : pleaded guilty to being concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the importation of a controlled drug .
     [java] 
     [java] In fact , that was part of the trouble , more often than not it is the protestations and evasions of a witness which tell most about him .
     [java] 
     [java] The almost unanimous electoral abstention of CNT members in November 1933 , in protest at the shortcomings of Republican reformism and the repressiveness of the Azaya governments towards the CNT itself , contributed significantly to the left 's defeat .
     [java] 
     [java] It has been compared to the first ascent of Everest .
     [java] 
     [java] Complex social problems have to be tackled including homelessness , imprisonment , birth of an infected child and death of one or even both parents .
     [java] 
     [java] Lucy Keane , defending , said the tragedy arose from the mother 's unhappy childhood and adolescence and the unhappy relationship she had which resulted in the birth of her son .
     [java] 
     [java] In the last chapter he described the birth of his son .
     [java] 
     [java] Certainly , he was blind to the true nature of Hitler and Nazism until the autumn of 1938 .
     [java] 
     [java] We repudiate the lies of Priest Murphy , bachelor agent of a foreign power and brand as traitors all those associated with him and those who hastened to do his will .
     [java] 
     [java] A misrepresentation of history which has had a malignant effect on the affairs of Lewis and of crofting ever since .
     [java] 
     [java] Distinguished specialists in international law have reached a number of quite different conclusions about the legality of the use and possession of nuclear weapons .
     [java] 
     [java] The important words so far as this appeal is concerned are the words `` any enactment or rule of law restricting the right of any other person to recover possession of the premises . ''
     [java] 
     [java] This could occur where someone has a lien over the goods , i.e. a right to retain possession of them until a debt is paid .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1922 , he made The Man Without Desire , an imaginative account of a man who wakes from a sleep of several hundred years only to find he suffers from a lack of emotion .
     [java] 
     [java] The Autobiography of a Luftwaffe Pilot .
     [java] 
     [java] Oscar Wilde 's Ballad of Reading Gaol tells of the hanging of a trooper at the prison :
     [java] 
     [java] Seating ourselves on the trunk of an old ash-tree that stretched along the ground , Coleridge read aloud with a sonorous and musical voice , the ballad of Betty Foy .
     [java] 
     [java] The Ballad of a Sad Cafe
     [java] 
     [java] The fifth was a biography of a famous writer , which Boy read twice with great fascination .
     [java] 
     [java] Vasari recorded it in situ in his biography of Cosimo Roselli , but the work has since been attributed to the Master of the Fiesole `` Epiphany '' , a follower of Domenico Ghirlandaio .
     [java] 
     [java] As Paul Preston 's authoritative biography of Franco demonstrates , there is no real evidence to support the notion , amply diffused by Francoist propaganda after 1945 , that Franco skilfully kept Spain out of the conflict .
     [java] 
     [java] He compiled a chronicle of world history , fitting together the calculations of Greek chroniclers with the indications of date found in the Bible .
     [java] 
     [java] These years are not dealt with in the chronicle of the Phoenix Kings .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 've just sold a comedy of Philip 's about air travel , '' she said .
     [java] 
     [java] The diary of Edmund Crocker of Frome , 8 February 1799 .
     [java] 
     [java] My diary of 8th September that year notes : Towerbell shares have flopped ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] When they got it home to Suffolk , they discovered a small black-bound notebook containing the Diary of Henry Oakeley for the years 1869-1871 .
     [java] 
     [java] How deep one has to go , to distinguish not `` the man '' from `` the poet '' but `` the-man-who-is-the-poet '' , appears from Olson 's splendid essay of 1949 , `` Granpa , Goodbye '' .
     [java] 
     [java] It refers to the fable of the sick lion and the wary fox , who is frightened at seeing all the footprints pointing towards the den and none the other way .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1974 Mr Coase turned his own attention to lighthouses -- an example of supposed market failure with an even longer pedigree than the fable of the bees .
     [java] 
     [java] And there was a picture engraved on glass , illustrating the fable of the milkmaid and her pail .
     [java] 
     [java] No doubt Flaubert knew La Fontaine 's fable of the Bear and the Man Who Delighted in Gardens .
     [java] 
     [java] A recent monograph of Jacob Epstein 's memorial sculpture to the naturalist W. H. Hudson at Hyde Park Corner may be used as an example .
     [java] 
     [java] BEFORE THE END of his mammoth production Birds of Europe and his Monograph of Toucans ever came into view , Gould began planning his next major project .
     [java] 
     [java] Shusaku Endo 's novel of ideas can be read as symbolism or old-fashioned realism , for it works neatly on both levels .
     [java] 
     [java] The novels of H. Rider Haggard offer a clear illustration of the white man 's behaviour during the penetration into Africa .
     [java] 
     [java] Nevertheless , the proposed stimuli are myth and folk song and , hopefully , these are meant to lead on to the poetry of Blake and Shakespeare .
     [java] 
     [java] An example of this can be seen in his youthful discovery of the biblical poems of the Anglo-Saxon poet Cynewulf .
     [java] 
     [java] It turned out to be the poems of Tennyson , bound in green morocco .
     [java] 
     [java] The sonnets of Bowles struck Coleridge with the force of revelation , seeming to him , in their natural use of language and heartfelt expression of personal feeling , unlike anything he had ever read .
     [java] 
     [java] The sonnets of Astrophil and Stella that follow may be the result of taking the muses ' advice or ignoring the advice .
     [java] 
     [java] The present writer , brought up in a house containing unattractive thrillers of the Sapper era , discovered among that unillustrated and unilluminating Hodder Stoughton material a correspondence-course crammer , an outline of plane geometry .
     [java] 
     [java] In any case , I believe Eliot admired the thrillers of the prolific E. Phillips Oppenheim , who was published in the yellow-backed series to which he more than once referred as a possible source of inspiration .
     [java] 
     [java] According to a manual of etiquette published in the 1840s , readers were advised that , `` Care should be taken not to place books by authors of different sexes next to each other '' .
     [java] 
     [java] ITT Sheraton : an inch thick manual of good practice ; initiatives ranging from tree planting to voluntary donations from customers matched by the hotels and given to local conservationists .
     [java] 
     [java] But , before delegation of cases to local judges could take place on a wide scale , there needed to be a manual of existing canon law as recognized in the West .
     [java] 
     [java] His duties included the preparation of a handbook of Instructions for the use of farriers attached to the British Cavalry and to the Honourable Board of Ordnance .
     [java] 
     [java] The Artist 's Handbook Of Materials And Techniques
     [java] 
     [java] My handbook of psychiatry blames it all on my childhood -- well it would , would n't it ?
     [java] 
     [java] The packages proved to contain the paperback of Salman Rushdie 's The Satanic Verses , published by a unidentified consortium in order to protect those responsible from any grim repercussions .
     [java] 
     [java] Two paperbacks of 40 folk tales have appeared and are local bestsellers .
     [java] 
     [java] To win one of 25 copies of the Book of Secrets , tell us on a postcard who wrote The Great Lover and send it to Country Living /Love at the address on page 2 by 31 March .
     [java] 
     [java] For Winifred there were some hair ribbons too , and a book of tales by Maria Edgeworth ; for Young John , a halfdozen new brass buttons and a coloured alphabet book .
     [java] 
     [java] The magazine of the World Health Organisation , appearing bimonthly .
     [java] 
     [java] We can see why , if we turn the pages of the only surviving detailed account of the Celtic invasion of 278 B.C. in Pausanias , Book 10 .

     [java] Obituary of Brig Jack Winchester
     [java] 
     [java] Obituary of Wim Van Leer
     [java] 
     [java] I congratulate you that there is so soon to appear another volume of your favourite Mrs. Leapor 's poetry .
     [java] 
     [java] A similar quest can be pursued for the first book with gilt lettering on the spine -- generally accepted as being the third volume of a set of Byron published by Murray in 1832 .
     [java] 
     [java] It has been the setting for the marriages of numerous MPs and the subsequent baptism of their offspring in its Welsh marble font .
     [java] 
     [java] Accordingly , he begins his Gospel with the story of the baptism of Jesus .
     [java] 
     [java] He assisted at the baptism of Henry 's daughter Eleanor in 1161 and at the translations of dukes Richard I and II at Fecamp in 1162 and of Edward the Confessor at Westminster in 1163 .
     [java] 
     [java] I have always hated that vulgar pomp with which the rite of marriage is coupled .
     [java] 
     [java] Religion is presented as a response `` everywhere to one and the same need '' : the need for rituals of fertility .
     [java] 
     [java] It is the rituals of the Church which particularly attract the local people .
     [java] 
     [java] To soothe the nationalists , Franco resorted yet again to the rituals of Falangism to remind everyone what were the constants of his power .
     [java] 
     [java] But the more he repeated the simple daily rituals of Muslim belief , the more he felt the urge to adopt a brusque , English attitude to them .
     [java] 
     [java] I can say this with sympathy and love even though I am , as many know , entirely supportive of the ordination of women .
     [java] 
     [java] On May 17 , 1990 , the general synod of the Church of Ireland voted in favour of the ordination of women as priests and bishops .
     [java] 
     [java] The people of Nanking , Korea and Singapore have n't forgotten the cruelties of the past .
     [java] 
     [java] He practises what he has always preached -- respect and tolerance for people of whatever religion , who try to live a good life by their own creed .
     [java] 
     [java] The crucial issue which this sort of situation emphasises is the vital importance of perception between persons of different cultures , which can only be partially ameliorated by the procedure suggested by James Lee .
     [java] 
     [java] Mothers of Welsh infants of similar age were then recruited from the same areas of the city ; they were thus living in similar accommodation and served by the same health professionals .
     [java] 
     [java] For a few years chimpanzees raised in human households learn as well as human infants of the same age , but they soon reach the limit of their ability and are rapidly overtaken by human youngsters .
     [java] 
     [java] The youth of Port Talbot were broken in on great drama and fired , from the beginning , to reach for the sky .
     [java] 
     [java] While watching the Moi trackers scurrying up the trees , he began to daydream of how he would return alone to compete with all the youths of her village in feats of strength and athleticism .
     [java] 
     [java] Clearly also she is a lady of character and determination who is , or can be , fiercely protective of her charges .
     [java] 
     [java] The lady of the house placed herself in a chair opposite Carla 's .
     [java] 
     [java] When I had finished , her abdomen was lifted high and nipped in like a wasp-waisted Victorian lady of fashion .
     [java] 
     [java] So I 'm a lady of leisure for the next six weeks ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] Publicans were frequently men of working-class origin , who sought prosperity without leaving their community .
     [java] 
     [java] Bettinson is a man of considerable dignity , diplomatic and not given to emotional language .
     [java] 
     [java] She remembered what Faye had said tonight about him being a man of high principles , and gradually it started to make sense .
     [java] 
     [java] `` What is it ? '' asked the eight-year-old , delighted that he had somehow managed to amuse this mature woman of nineteen .
     [java] 
     [java] `` He seems to be a gentleman of leisure , that young man , '' Lesley continued thoughtfully .
     [java] 
     [java] The Eucharist is the sacrament of salvation and , as such , it declares the work of Christ as he fulfils the Father 's will and draws all people to God .
     [java] 
     [java] My suggestion is that churches should institute the Sacrament of Feet Washing in its rightful and proper place .
     [java] 
     [java] Others were selected , and it is not known how , as the parish church for an area , in which the sacraments of baptism , marriage and burial were allowed .
     [java] 
     [java] Asked if he had any identifying marks he pulled up his sleeve and pointed to a tiny tattoo of an obscene word .
     [java] 
     [java] The incomprehensible incantations would cast no spell over him , any more than the tattoo of the spider had glued him forever to his gang .
     [java] 
     [java] The recent calculations were done only for the collision of an electron and a positron , a collision common in particle accelerators .
     [java] 
     [java] The contorted peaks of the Torres del Paine rise at the very site of collision of two of the world 's largest plates -- the South American and the Antarctican Plates .
     [java] 
     [java] ALMOST four years after the 1985 crash of an airliner in Gander , Newfoundland , in which 248 US servicemen were killed , a group of congressmen are pressing for a new inquiry into the disaster .
     [java] 
     [java] Now the latest news on the crash of the American fighter plane at the United States airforce base at Upper Heyford .
     [java] 
     [java] He would have felt no less if he 'd been told that Berowne was dead of a coronary or killed in a car smash .
     [java] 
     [java] It also raises thousands of pounds which are distributed to charities and worthy groups and individuals of the area .
     [java] 
     [java] Now clearly , he responds every day to individuals of the public .
     [java] 
     [java] Elizabeth Woodville , informed of the arrest of her brother and of her son by a former marriage , as well as of the young king 's faithful chamberlain , was beside herself with anger and anxiety .
     [java] 
     [java] The arrest of the `` Gang of Four '' in October 1976 eliminated them from the power struggle .
     [java] 
     [java] The arrest of two members of the ruling Transition Committee for the Salvation of the People ( CTSP ) was announced in late June .
     [java] 
     [java] Then came the dramatic arrest of Roderick last August when the Royal Navy frigate Argonaut intercepted his yacht 150 miles south west of Gibraltar .
     [java] 
     [java] The apex of the dome was surmounted by a colossal figure , over 16 ft. high , representing `` Progress '' .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1943 a bomb entered the apex of the south wall , passed through the building and demolished the north wall , completely destroying the organ .
     [java] 
     [java] South Africa is a sub-tropical country forming the apex of the African Countries .
     [java] 
     [java] Bernice had reached the apex of the terminal dome by now .
     [java] 
     [java] The military had placed picquets along the base of the foothills to prevent anyone escaping into them .
     [java] 
     [java] The fourth hole has reached a depth of 1850 m beginning at the base of the sheeted dykes , so as to sample the gabbro .
     [java] 
     [java] The nonsmoker breathes `` sidestream '' smoke from the burning tip of the cigarette and `` mainstream '' smoke that has been inhaled and then exhaled by the smoker .
     [java] 
     [java] GABRIEL DID get a pair of wings made from filigree wire quilted with the tips of peacock feathers .
     [java] 
     [java] It was with great difficulty that she persuaded the two dogs into the rear of the van , and they barked their protest all the way back to the surgery .
     [java] 
     [java] It was a bright day now but the cafe , tucked in at the foot of the buildings that hemmed in the square , was in the shade .
     [java] 
     [java] She pointed to the foot of Georgina 's desk .
     [java] 
     [java] And as for the Ark of Moses , this was the sacred chest fashioned at the foot of Mount Sinai to contain the sacred tablets of stone .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Kelleher looked up to the yellow face of the kitchen clock .
     [java] 
     [java] One can distinguish a typical trajectory -- shown moving down from the upper left of the figure -- as married couples reach the statutory retirement-age .
     [java] 
     [java] Now , he strolled towards the left of the stage and began to sing , `` Strolling with Nancy '' .
     [java] 
     [java] According to the constitution , Mr Havel should be elected by December 24 -- within two weeks of the resignation of President Husak .
     [java] 
     [java] Friday 's resignation of the finance minister , Giovanni Goria , and the health minister , Francesco de Lorenzo , both tainted by corruption scandals , hammered the lira .
     [java] 
     [java] Reasons given for transnational participation are : continuity of research to overcome shortfalls of younger scientists entering the field in view of the imminent retirement of many senior scientists and to provide advanced training .
     [java] 
     [java] His appointment comes with next month 's retirement of assistant chief constable Fred Smith .
     [java] 
     [java] Significantly , however , it also recommended safeguards against the dismissal of chief officers including a proposal to prevent dismissal of a chief executive except on the vote of two-thirds of council membership .
     [java] 
     [java] Mantilla ordered the dismissals of the officer concerned and of his commander .
     [java] 
     [java] A year later a major steel plant announced the dismissal of 901 of its 3700 workers :
     [java] 
     [java] Discussions between the FDA , the Japanese Ministry of Welfare and Health and the EC have led to agreement on proposals to avoid duplication of clinical trials on humans and reduce unnecessary animal testing .
     [java] 
     [java] In addition to granting sub-licences the taxpayer from time to time provided facilities for the duplication of films from the master film onto video cassettes and for dubbing which was carried out by sub-contractors .
     [java] 
     [java] Furthermore , to avoid the necessity of duplication of records , there should be a place for recording the profiling categories common to most record of achievement schemes .
     [java] 
     [java] The two clusters evolved by duplication of an ancestral gene cluster before the divergence of the human and great ape lineages .
     [java] 
     [java] The Green movement is partly due to the flower people reaching a crest of economic power .
     [java] 
     [java] The vast curling crest of the hurricane reared over them , and its face stretched from horizon to horizon .
     [java] 
     [java] And beyond the crest of the headland , hazy with distance , the shape of a hill , smooth and symmetrical , like a drawn-up knee .
     [java] 
     [java] We retreated to the crest of the island , and sat down where the turf was clean and dry .
     [java] 
     [java] The scores of islands which lie off the Adriatic coast are the crests of mountain ranges which foundered during periods of tectonic disturbances .
     [java] 
     [java] We took her to see the Three Howes , prehistoric mounds on the summit of the moors .
     [java] 
     [java] But missing the summit of a tower means you ca n't leave your name and a message to the future in the route book , usually found in a flag-like tin box on the top .
     [java] 
     [java] We crossed the Sacramento on the bleached bones of an old dead pine and pitched camp in a meadow 6,000 feet above sea level , under the summit of Mount Eddy .
     [java] 
     [java] We 're near the summit of the hill , deep in the bushes under the thin cover of trees ; the smell is very strong and my knees feel like the bones are gone .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1985 he was made Head Gardener of Killerton , an arboretum famous for its rare trees and shrubs .
     [java] 
     [java] It was this democratic claim that shocked the conservative lawyers of the Council of Castile , and the judges of the Audiencias .
     [java] 
     [java] With age the lining of the arteries becomes narrowed and roughened : this process is known as atherosclerosis .
     [java] 
     [java] This allows the lining of the uterus to be cleared out properly , and thus provide a good implantation site for the new fetus to settle on .
     [java] 
     [java] More than 100 jobs have been axed , a For Sale sign has gone up over a large slice of its assets and chief executive Andros Stakis has been ousted .
     [java] 
     [java] sherry and dissolved sugar added to ice and garnished with slices of orange .
     [java] 
     [java] The lemonade , cold as ice , in a deep earthenware jug with slices of lemon floating on top , was delicious .
     [java] 
     [java] I feed it on a diet of earthworms , cooked chicken , prawns and slices of raw cod .
     [java] 
     [java] Add a cinnamon stick or a few slices of fresh root ginger , then simmer for a few minutes -- check it has a good flavour , then remove the spices and add 450g/1lb chopped rhubarb .
     [java] 
     [java] Decorate with a slice of kiwi and a sprig of mint .
     [java] 
     [java] It is still possible to open a door and find a dozen women sitting quietly round a bench sewing small squares of silk , with all the cloistered intensity of medieval seamstresses .
     [java] 
     [java] To create an interesting decorative effect with mirrors , you may like to consider mirror mosaic , which consists of small squares of mirror held in place on a fabric backing .
     [java] 
     [java] I would make it is squares of fairly course cotton eyelet lace with a simple crochet edging , perhaps with alternate large squares of lace and plain knitting .
     [java] 
     [java] This is a noisy , rumbustious film that 's prone to burying itself in hails of gunshots and sheets of flame .
     [java] 
     [java] The floor was dark green and shiny like a sheet of still water , and everything else was white .
     [java] 
     [java] These glands are surrounded by sheets of muscle which , when contracted , squeeze the venom out into the barb .
     [java] 
     [java] His quill pen scratched away on a sheet of treated notepaper , creating a little masterpiece of querulous complaint about a mistress Byron was tired of .
     [java] 
     [java] A rapid gear change gave them speed on the corner and he sat bent over the wheel , concentrating fiercely on the road through the sheets of rain .
     [java] 
     [java] Most popular pool-liners consist merely of a sheet of heavy-gauge polythene or rubber material which is placed in the excavation and moulded to its contours .
     [java] 
     [java] This consists of a very flat sheet of metallic lead , about 8 mm thickness , bonded to a standard steel lap disc .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Wilson dressed quietly and respectably in floating grey or black , the large hat which covered her coils of iron-grey hair complementing her height .
     [java] 
     [java] The road worsened as I edged gingerly down along the country 's sunken spine , vanishing at times in coils of thick black mud .
     [java] 
     [java] The thick coils of hair had been pinned up beneath it by a patient Sister Anne , who sighed as she went about her task .
     [java] 
     [java] When she examined his eye she saw the splinter , a tiny coil of metal shaving which appeared to be sticking to the iris .
     [java] 
     [java] Papal encyclicals came to be consulted by this route , as did the current treatises of Ius Publicun on church -- state relations .
     [java] 
     [java] A treatise of the nature of such simples as are most frequently used ( 1652 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] I have , on occasion , bought sticks of pastel which have crumbled into pieces when I removed the paper wrapper -- this has NEVER happened to me with Schmincke pastels .
     [java] 
     [java] She took a cigar box from a cupboard , opened it and displayed a number of sticks of greasepaint .
     [java] 
     [java] First every stick of furniture gets carted off , and all my labour-saving appliances , then the carpets and the curtains , if you please .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Vitamin pills , some eyedrops if you do n't want bloodshot eyes after long flights , and a stick of men 's deodorant .
     [java] 
     [java] He stirred his tea with the stick of plastic provided .
     [java] 
     [java] The strip of mahogany has the grain running lengthwise .
     [java] 
     [java] The French beans are wrapped in a strip of bacon .
     [java] 
     [java] The rain wash-off into the ravine had flushed the goodness out of the soil , so that instead of grass , there was a strip of thin scrub and stunted trees .
     [java] 
     [java] A strip of turf between tapes and banners in the grounds of the Victoria Wells Hotel proved to be the kindest terrain the leaders had encountered in two hours .
     [java] 
     [java] Fix in place with strips of tape attached to the edge of the container .
     [java] 
     [java] The runway is simply a strip of grass , cleared of rocks .
     [java] 
     [java] Then she snipped the long , long strips of satin into tiny squares .
     [java] 
     [java] What would you do if they came and built a hotel on this stretch of coast ?
     [java] 
     [java] It was a bad place to be stranded , a lonely stretch of country lane with a thin band of trees on either side and it was deserted .
     [java] 
     [java] Around the coast and in river valleys there are stretches of tropical jungle with pythons and other snakes .
     [java] 
     [java] Because of our late start and leisurely progress , the light is thickening as we stumble along the forgotten stretch of ridge between Bwlch Ciliau .
     [java] 
     [java] At a bend in the river there was a wide , deep puddle to be negotiated , and , stepping back , Emily tried to stride to a firmer stretch of path .
     [java] 
     [java] His bare feet could identify all the frayed patches on the long ribbon of carpet and each worn tread on the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] The ribbon of tarmac goes on to the lonely outpost of Leck Fell House , a speck of civilisation in a wide panorama that has no other sign of life .
     [java] 
     [java] Lift the knife to make a space beneath and slip in a ribbon of pepper .
     [java] 
     [java] A three-inch ribbon of snow , sideways up , is balanced on the telephone wires until , now and then , a bird lets on them , and ten or twenty yards fall like droppings into the street .
     [java] 
     [java] The miracle accounts are not historical reports of what happened .
     [java] 
     [java] A Radio Monte Carlo report of Oct. 6 stated that Saudi Arabia had recalled its ambassador to Jordan that day .
     [java] 
     [java] Reports of the deaths of five people while detained by the police in January 1991 aroused the concern of the Helsinki Watch human rights group .
     [java] 
     [java] There were reports of serious disturbances in Punjab and the North West Frontier Province .
     [java] 
     [java] North of the Arctic Circle Norway has some fine mountainous country and Finnmark , an expanse of flatter tundra that offers a very different and , in winter , a very cold trip .
     [java] 
     [java] Sure enough , at the top , when he had found his way through a screen of brambles , he could see the tumbledown shed across an expanse of gardens .
     [java] 
     [java] The curtains were of heavy velvet , but seemed somewhat skimpy for the expanse of window .
     [java] 
     [java] Near by is a quay , at the side of an estuary , and here the scenery becomes melancholy and fiat ; expanses of mud , saltish commons , the marsh-birds crying .
     [java] 
     [java] She stopped and looked at the garden ; inside the square was a circle of flower beds .
     [java] 
     [java] It would be misleading therefore , effectively to write off the outer circle of kin as significant sources of support in British society .
     [java] 
     [java] He gathered his own particular circle of close advisers around him and was prone to discount views that did not reflect those prevailing in his own circle .
     [java] 
     [java] Laputa is a circle of land , about eight kilometres across , covered with houses and other buildings .
     [java] 
     [java] She had made her a cool and sweet-smelling bed of grasses inside a circle of powder to keep away ants and other insects .
     [java] 
     [java] Alexei 's favourite spot was in what he supposed might have been termed a clearing -- at least it was in the centre of a circle of four rocks , each one the size of a crouching man .
     [java] 
     [java] Some kung fu clubs place a blindfolded student amid a circle of fellow students , who attack him with one technique at intermittent intervals .
     [java] 
     [java] Over to your right in the distance , half-hidden by a fold of land , is a broken circle of stone monoliths .
     [java] 
     [java] The engagingly eccentric editorials of veteran Brussels-watcher Emanuele Gazzo , founder of Agence Europe , gives his fly-sheet the decided edge in terms of amusement value .
     [java] 
     [java] Soon Maggie held a golden ball of thread and St Margaret had one end of it firmly attached to her finger .
     [java] 
     [java] As the echoes of the big bang died away , the universe evolved from a bland ball of gas into a lacy web of galaxies .
     [java] 
     [java] She noticed a pile of yellowed newspapers under the opposite ledge , and a rusty trowel and fork , and a ball of green twine wound in criss-cross pattern around a stick .
     [java] 
     [java] Reserve ( tightly wrapped ) a smallish ball of white fondant and colour the remainder blue .
     [java] 
     [java] Roll balls of paste for the heads and position on top of larger balls for the bodies .
     [java] 
     [java] But food products and balls of bubblegum like this are n't subject to the same restrictions .
     [java] 
     [java] Ziegler gave Sharpe a length of cold sausage , a hard-boiled egg and a piece of black bread .
     [java] 
     [java] `` To think of that vast length of tube supported only at its ends and a whole train running through it . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I do n't believe that we 're all born equal , as lumps of dough that are later shaped by our peers and parents and so forth
     [java] 
     [java] Inside the solid lumps of our brain lives the experience which appears to the subject as an ordered world , the room in which I write for example .
     [java] 
     [java] As the liquid boiled off , it left a brown stalactite-like lump of plutonium and salt hanging down the side of the container and a mound on the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] The `` Shivering Mountain '' derives its name from being a distinctly unstable lump of land , given to landslips .
     [java] 
     [java] The chef mashed a lump of raw gristle on his stove , and kept it down until it was half charcoal .
     [java] 
     [java] Flat flakes of gold are more difficult to trap as their weight to surface area is small and they have a tendency to escape over the edge .
     [java] 
     [java] A little black flake of mascara 's got trapped behind it .
     [java] 
     [java] For much of that period the area was probably part of one of many statelets beyond the western edge of the early kingdom of East Anglia .
     [java] 
     [java] A child leaning over the edge of a precipice .
     [java] 
     [java] About 1 cm from the outside edge of the ring , push the fabric square firmly into the ring so the centre is embedded in the foam by about 1cm and the fabric corners stand up .
     [java] 
     [java] Then why do I always feel as if I am falling off the edge of a cliff ?
     [java] 
     [java] As the action proper begins , Poseidon and Athene rush a white curtain round the perimeter of the auditorium .
     [java] 
     [java] The location of the perimeter of a square can be described by continuous lines .
     [java] 
     [java] Murray splashed round the perimeter of the enclosure and turned off the shower .
     [java] 
     [java] Today a narrow road follows closely the eleven mile perimeter of inlets and bays .
     [java] 
     [java] In fact small plants really are better as edgings , at the front or round the perimeter of the bed .
     [java] 
     [java] The perimeter of any polygon is simply the distance all the way round the edges .
     [java] 
     [java] Now whether this has anything to do with a conflict between right and left halves of the brain is not really the issue here .
     [java] 
     [java] In the lower half of El Greco 's `` Burial of the Count of Orgaz '' in Toledo there is a line-up of angular , ruffed mourners .
     [java] 
     [java] Lewis watched the silhouette gradually form behind the opaque glass in the upper half of the front door .
     [java] 
     [java] One has only to glance at a human skeleton to see the numerous segments of the vertebral column .
     [java] 
     [java] Even more notably it was the speech , not of a subordinate minister , but of a leader , striking a new note , and invoking an enthusiastic response from a broad segment of the electorate .
     [java] 
     [java] Study 5 involved a collaborative problem-solving task in which children ordered , in sequence , the segments of strip cartoon stories .
     [java] 
     [java] Watching it all was Vicky Richards , manager of both Forsbrand and Spence .
     [java] 
     [java] Benne Johannsen , manager of the Danish champions , travelled to Georgia with Linfield for the first leg and he 's not too keen on going back .
     [java] 
     [java] In addition , these user histories point to the fact that the receptionists of some surgeries were instructed to turn away `` addicts '' or , at least , segregate them from the rest of the patients .
     [java] 
     [java] A former maid of the Princess Royal has won the right to sue a national newspaper .
     [java] 
     [java] John Parker of Belton was a servant of Lord Hastings though retained to Lord Mountjoy .
     [java] 
     [java] This , in fact , referred to the sequestration of a clerk 's benefice by the bishop rather than to excommunication , but its principle was all-embracing and even included the servants of royal servants .
     [java] 
     [java] He was indisputably a loyal servant of Edward II , but he was not the will-less , visionless opportunist which his skilful pragmatism may suggest .
     [java] 
     [java] Each slung a tin collecting box over his shoulder and an attendant of the Company carried a receptacle for larger discoveries .
     [java] 
     [java] The attendants of Naga Royalty also possess only one head .
     [java] 
     [java] Only Jean de Grilly ( seneschal 1266-8 ) and Thomas de Ippegrave , clerk of Edward 's household ( 1268-9 ) , seem to have been the results of Edward 's own personal choice .
     [java] 
     [java] I was appointed as an Assistant Clerk of Nottinghamshire County Council in 1974 with about 15 staff , covering the work of the Planning , Highway , Police and Public Protection Committees .
     [java] 
     [java] More and more doctors realise that diet can influence disease , William Pryor , professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Louisiana State University , USA , told the conference .
     [java] 
     [java] The man behind the scheme is John Durant , Professor of Public Understanding of Science at Imperial College , London , and an assistant director of the museum .
     [java] 
     [java] The doctor has been sent on leave from her post as an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard .
     [java] 
     [java] Sir George Porter , of the Royal Institution in London , and George Pimentel , then associate professor of chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley , began work on exploiting matrix isolation in 1954 .
     [java] 
     [java] Therefore , on the second occasion you find the rabbits occupying a restricted section of the system .
     [java] 
     [java] A powerful section of the Labour Party was demanding that Britain withdraw .
     [java] 
     [java] The hair that frames your face ( hairline ) and the top section of the head ( crown ) are two areas John Frieda designates as Crucial Zones because these form the entire surface area of the style .
     [java] 
     [java] It took thirty minutes for them to locate a frayed section of the Bridge ; force its weave apart with clamps and keep the gap open with plastic crates .
     [java] 
     [java] Each topic in the sequence of topics contained in your outline can be translated into a section of your essay .
     [java] 
     [java] Fragments of slate appeared as if by magic on the lawn .
     [java] 
     [java] She popped a fragment of biscuit into her mouth and crunched it primly with her front teeth .
     [java] 
     [java] In addition , about 36 fragments of metallic nickel-iron meteorites have been collected , one of which contains minute diamonds , and is the second of its kind known in the world .
     [java] 
     [java] At the back it was stained with a little blood , and in the rough texture of the wool I found fragments of tinder from the broken branch .
     [java] 
     [java] Fragments of paper were missing from some of the pages and quite a few names were faded , some almost beyond recognition .
     [java] 
     [java] The extensive Pevensey Levels of 36 square kilometres are largely a result of the enclosure or inning of a large bay studded with small clay islands called `` eyes '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Andrew Hudson hooks his co-Man of the Match Curtly Ambrose for four during his monumental innings of 163 .
     [java] 
     [java] Before Byas and White joined forces , however , Yorkshire were sent on their way with a stunning innings of 57 from skipper Martyn Moxon , whose savage assault contained four fours and three sixes .
     [java] 
     [java] Just as England 's hopes were dying in the third and final Test against India in Bombay , Hick revived his side with a magnificent innings of 99 not out .
     [java] 
     [java] The ice-covered ocean surrounding Antarctica was first penetrated by Captain James Cook , RN , in his exploratory voyages of 1773 and 1774 ( Cook , 1961 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Since the murderous excursions of Jack the Ripper in London 's East End some years ago , the patrolling of streets on both sides of the river had been strictly enforced , particularly on foggy nights .
     [java] 
     [java] The French had invested money there , had built the Suez canal and recalled Napoleon 's expedition of 1798 .
     [java] 
     [java] It is hard to believe that Thucydides when he wrote these words had not lived to see at least the Spartan Thibron 's Asian expedition of 400 .
     [java] 
     [java] He served in Scotland in the 1545 expedition of Edward Seymour , first Earl of Hertford [ q.v . ] .
     [java] 
     [java] He served in the Lisbon expedition of 1826 and retired on half pay in January 1831 with the rank of major .
     [java] 
     [java] If you are unsure about the adequacy of your daily diet , look at the list of symptoms below .
     [java] 
     [java] This second report did not re-emphasise the need for massive resource transfers , instead it concentrated on the adequacy of the international financial system and the debt problem faced by many countries .
     [java] 
     [java] This `` rediscovery of poverty '' would seem to be a function of an academic and political interest that had emerged , concerned to look at the adequacy of social policies .
     [java] 
     [java] I hope that they will not be interpreted as questioning the adequacy of existing services .
     [java] 
     [java] In general terms , the objectives will be to evaluate the adequacy of systems to control time , cost and quality
     [java] 
     [java] As the struggle progressed he came to see the inadequacies of the term and realized that it was too constricted in its meaning and gave rise to confusion and misunderstanding .
     [java] 
     [java] So here the relationship between the lexical concepts has to be marked in some way to make up for the inadequacy of the words to indicate what part of the general context of knowledge is to be engaged .
     [java] 
     [java] Most researchers are at some stage forced up against the inadequacy of the social class classification .
     [java] 
     [java] The church 's response says that by its own admission the Scottish Office Education Department recognises the inadequacies of its proposals .
     [java] 
     [java] Corporate America has plenty of problems .
     [java] 
     [java] Even if camping is still a complete turn-off for her there are plenty of creative ways to enjoy the outdoors without camping .
     [java] 
     [java] This procedure provides plenty of room for fudging the figures and building in arbitrary assumptions .
     [java] 
     [java] It too had plenty of time to make its dispositions .
     [java] 
     [java] In practice it is quite complex because you need at least six lasers to trap a clump of atoms ; the lasers also have to be tuned to the natural movement of the atoms .
     [java] 
     [java] Some of the scenery is very Scottish-looking with clumps of birch and hawthorn by the roadside and a scatter of tiny farming villages .
     [java] 
     [java] Derek stumbled off into the nearest clump of vegetation and disturbed three petrified rabbits .
     [java] 
     [java] Snow lay in dark hollows below occasional clumps of rhododendron .
     [java] 
     [java] Away to their left , the bank sloped down again into clumps of alder , among which the stream could be heard chattering over gravel .
     [java] 
     [java] They peered over ant-hills and looked cautiously round clumps of teazle .
     [java] 
     [java] The hills have clumps of rocks precariously balanced on them .
     [java] 
     [java] She looked up at the rook 's nest and the grey sky beyond , then bent to pick a clump of white winter aconites to take home to Josh .
     [java] 
     [java] Bright green lizards were scuttling over a clump of tree-roots twice as tall as Alan , and he was wide awake .
     [java] 
     [java] But still Flupper continued in the wrong direction , heading for the greyish clumps of mould and fungi .
     [java] 
     [java] Its great clumps of rough , hairy stems can grow up to 6ft tall .
     [java] 
     [java] Here , a small clump of scarlet tulips brings a disproportionate flash of brilliance to a spring dalliance of Daphne mezereum , muscari , erythronium and Magnolia stellata

     [java] 
     [java] Mr Eggar also rejected schemes near bird sanctuaries at Pembroke , Lundy , the east of Scotland , north Norfolk and the English Channel .
     [java] 
     [java] Or would it be fairer to convict the harm-doer of a lesser offence , thus ignoring the chance result ?
     [java] 
     [java] An exact match will be sufficient to convict the farmer of a pollution infringement .
     [java] 
     [java] Over more than six days they convicted Allitt of four murders , three attempted murders and six charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent .
     [java] 
     [java] The Law Society will have powers to suspend a solicitor convicted of a serious crime from practice before taking disciplinary proceedings , and to intervene in the practices of solicitors who are incapacitated or have abandoned their practices .
     [java] 
     [java] A CROWN court judge is considering recommending the deportation of a man convicted of deception .
     [java] 
     [java] Now , you might feel that there is a significant difference between a murderer or bank robber and someone who has been wrongfully convicted of murder or bank robbery .
     [java] 
     [java] The case was brought by Michael Hickey , one of the men convicted of the murder of the newspaper boy Carl Bridgewater .
     [java] 
     [java] Most of those released are non-political prisoners convicted of criminal offences , but a number of prisoners of conscience will also be released .
     [java] 
     [java] There are fears that the acquittal of William Lozano will set off renewed riots in a city fraught with racial tension between Hispanic and black communities .
     [java] 
     [java] That day brought the acquittal of a white police officer , William Lozano , of the killing of two black men in January 1989 .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The acquittal of four white officers in April last year led to rioting in LA
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The principles of learning theory provide a prima-facie explanation of the linguistic changes which occur during childhood .
     [java] 
     [java] The view which is developed by Freud that religious responses will reflect changes in unconscious attitudes towards a person 's father enables his theory to provide an explanation of the changes in an individual 's attitudes towards God .
     [java] 
     [java] With that in mind there will be a brief explanation of the various types of e-mail and their different functions .
     [java] 
     [java] It was an era that demonstrated the incompatibility of labour and government as bedfellows .
     [java] 
     [java] And both of these contradictions of capitalism are built out of a developing incompatibility of bourgeoisie and civil society .
     [java] 
     [java] Following the trend to ensure compatibility of hardware and software developed on dissimilar systems , Sparc International is also reportedly working on another range of testing tools for the Sparc architecture .
     [java] 
     [java] We have good reason to doubt the compatibility of these moral aspirations , for an absolute restriction on the power to withdraw promises imposes a constraint upon liberty without necessarily promoting the liberty of others or oneself .
     [java] 
     [java] However , as other third party responses have been formulated , the compatibility of neutrality with the obligations of the United Nations Charter has been questioned .
     [java] 
     [java] Compatibility of information is thus maintained throughout the design operation .
     [java] 
     [java] That year she had flown from Paris to London for the christening of her sister Pauline 's third child , something she would not normally have done , for she disliked formal family occasions .
     [java] 
     [java] A LARGE congregation gathered for the consecration of the Church of Our Lady of Pity , Harlescott , Shrewsbury .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The test came over the choice of a new Archbishop of Canterbury .
     [java] 
     [java] When filling in the UCCA form , applicants will be asked to list their choice of universities in institution code number order ( ie the order in which the universities are listed in the UCCA handbook ) .
     [java] 
     [java] The main factor which governs the choice of materials and structural form is the ratio of the load on the structure to its dimensions .
     [java] 
     [java] The owners pride themselves on offering comfortable accommodation , on giving personal service with attention to detail and on providing a choice of good food .
     [java] 
     [java] One , it seemed to some of us , was the choice of Harlech as the name .
     [java] 
     [java] His manner was kind but official , and I could see that for some reason Aunt Louise distrusted him and was even a little afraid of him .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Do not be afraid of anyone but have reverence for Christ . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Too often , even if we are committed Christians , we are afraid of death and like secular society prefer to imagine that it will not happen to us or our loved ones .

     [java] 
     [java] The firm of Gerard Joshua Van Neck were `` general merchants '' , but unusually active in placing the capital of fellow Dutchmen ( and other continentals ) in the British public funds and company shares .
     [java] 
     [java] The Law Society and the BSI are drawing up plans which would allow firms of solicitors to apply for a kitemark .
     [java] 
     [java] Desire of Bachelors to be more than bachelors , to be husbands and fathers too .
     [java] 
     [java] Many , however , were less pessimistic about the malevolent desire of powerful vested interests to obstruct the progress of democracy and genuine peace .
     [java] 
     [java] The desire of politicians to control annual outcomes in this way was unrealistic when applied to a policy in which the industry 's own long-term objectives ( in this case overcoming the capacity backlog ) were in conflict .
     [java] 
     [java] In addition , the desire to keep up a respectable level of income or the desire of the woman to have a job or career , may lead to the woman going to work .
     [java] 
     [java] This is not out of nostalgia or for a longing of times gone by -- it is because it is a real top notch release !

     [java] It was stupid of me , '' Backley said .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It was therefore particularly stupid of you to sneak into the Mission on a Sunday and attempt to go behind my back .
     [java] 
     [java] He said , `` That was most improper of me if I did .
     [java] 
     [java] There must therefore be another reason for the Government 's proposals , and it was not honest or honourable of the Secretary of State to pretend otherwise .
     [java] 
     [java] The silliest and the most sinful of the many heresies of pseudo-democracy is to pretend that all studies and all learning are `` created equal '' .
     [java] 
     [java] That was wrong of me , but it in no way mitigates your own actions .
     [java] 
     [java] Sheriff Crozier said yesterday that it would have been wrong of him to deal with the matter behind the scenes .
     [java] 
     [java] The topic of sexism in language is probably the best known of all feminist linguistic concerns .
     [java] 
     [java] This enabled the topic of social relationships to be covered , although a direct question was also asked : `` Do you ever feel as though you 're on your own too much in the daytime ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] We shall say no more for the moment , but the difficult topic of meaning , intention , and motive will be central to Chapter 8 .

     [java] 
     [java] The intriguing history of the Scottish home over the past 400 years is now the subject of a three-year research project , which started in October 1991 .
     [java] 
     [java] The role of music , song , and poetry have been important to the YCCC as well , and this too is a central theme of Highlander .
     [java] 
     [java] Both events , Hayek 's death and Derrida 's threatened discomfiture , are relevant to the themes of Anderson 's latest collection of essays .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] `` How extraordinarily civil of you , '' he said cuttingly , `` but are n't you missing a rather important point ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] It was tactful of you not to say so .
     [java] 
     [java] They live with a constant dread of the telephone ringing because they fear it will bring bad news .
     [java] 
     [java] The people I knew had a terrific dread of it , and they very rightly dreaded it .
     [java] 
     [java] She claimed that `` there could be no redress for their horrible outrages in the County of Cornwall by reason of the general dread of the malice of Clemens and his lawless gang '' .
     [java] 
     [java] In competition it is to my advantage to feel for others as little as possible , an advantage which outweighs my dread of a growing isolation .

     [java] 
     [java] His enjoyment of music now led him into more theatrical pursuits .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'd have them all on if I needed a confidence boost , or just for the sheer enjoyment of the sound , but it was fundamentally one AC30 that made that noise .
     [java] 
     [java] It reveals the desperation of kids to get something from rock .
     [java] 
     [java] I still have it today , and I must admit that the `` poems '' indicate the desperation of a lonely adolescent rather than the promise of any talent .
     [java] 
     [java] The surge in sales last month was also directly inspired by price cuts which reflected the desperation of many shopkeepers faced with poor results in December , traditionally the peak buying season of the year .

     [java] 
     [java] Described by police as `` one of the most evil and dangerous men in Britain '' his grisly plan was fuelled by deep loathing of authority .
     [java] 
     [java] The public 's resentment of thrift operators and their accomplices is showing itself .
     [java] 
     [java] As Eve 's resentment of the family had grown , so had her interest in the cottage dwindled .
     [java] 
     [java] The editor , a nervous man always conscious that none of his immediate predecessors had lasted more than two years in the job , held his readers ' adoration of royalty as an article of faith .
     [java] 
     [java] Jaq sketched a minor adoration of respect .
     [java] 
     [java] But the main reason for this choice is my passionate , unwavering adoration of Brian Clough -- wott a man !
     [java] 
     [java] Indeed her adoration of him must have been a balm to his feelings of hurt and rejection because his attitude to her had become distinctly warmer of late .
     [java] 
     [java] Why should there be so much adoration of Esther Rantzen and so much favouritism extended towards her , and so much envy of and hostility towards the quite blameless , devastatingly lovely and completely inoffensive Selina Scott ? ''

     [java] 
     [java] From the singing tradition of North Antrim comes Len Graham -- unquestionably one of the best interpreters of the Irish folk song in the land .

     [java] Apparently you 've repented of your wicked life . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Do n't you worry , he 'll repent of his wicked ways all right , you leave that to me . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It is God who rejoices at the repentance of a sinner , just as the father rejoices at the return of the prodigal son .
     [java] 
     [java] But it was the remorse of youth -- intense , yet so shallow its depth is plumbed at a glance .
     [java] 
     [java] He made a good living , and seemed resentful of his wife 's decision to take in a lodger .
     [java] 
     [java] Gina glared across the table at him , uncomfortably aware that he was the source of her unreasonable impatience , and resentful of the effect his presence was having on her .

     [java] 
     [java] `` We feel very strongly about that and that the law should be changed for future children , so that they should be spared the anguish of separation and no contact at all . ''

     [java] 
     [java] Ashley laughed like a drain ; a teetotaller might have said her breath smelled like one .
     [java] 
     [java] Maybe this question had some relevance to the fact that there was a large space vacant before the stage -- or did the fish smell like fish ?

     [java] The flat smelled like the lair of a strange animal .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The thump of each explosion sounded like a door being slammed far beneath our feet .
     [java] 
     [java] The cage was now a few fe et off the ground and the noise , which sounded like metal being torn apart , was almost deafening .
     [java] 
     [java] I realized that I had completely forgotten what he sounded like .
     [java] 
     [java] And they stank , stank like cattle carcases outside an abattoir .
     [java] 
     [java] The cheese stunk like that .
     [java] 
     [java] The place stank like a sewer !

     [java] Maggie 's eyes and back are aching like hell .

     [java] My doctor tells me that leg of his must still be hurting like the devil .
     [java] 
     [java] My broken finger hurt like hell .
     [java] 
     [java] Where he had touched her her scalp was prickling like a porcupine .
     [java] 
     [java] When he threw in the meat , drops of hot water stung his hands like needles .
     [java] 
     [java] It rarely speaks , though if frightened it may bleat like a goat . some occasionally have goats ' shanks and hooves as well .
     [java] 
     [java] The nurses barking like hyenas , braying like donkeys .
     [java] 
     [java] In telling it , he cackled like a corncrake and waved his arms about .
     [java] 
     [java] She lay down , and he drifted off , and five minutes later the central heating was hissing and clanging like a forge .
     [java] 
     [java] The great wooden chalet creaked and resonated like a galleon in full sail .
     [java] 
     [java] Ivan toppled towards me , creaking like a rusty hinge .
     [java] 
     [java] The old house creaked in its joints like an old dog settling down for the night .
     [java] 
     [java] Growling like a mother cat may make a cat owner feel ridiculous , but if it helps to restrain a cat from tearing at a valuable chair , it is well worth a try .
     [java] 
     [java] Swarms of bats appeared over our camp at sunset , and hippos grunted like pigs at intervals throughout the night .
     [java] 
     [java] Blood drummed in her ears , blood gurgled like vomit in her throat , blood splashed in bright globules against the retinas of her closed eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] He flopped on to his back , gurgled like a sleeping infant , then opened his eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] It will hiss and bubble like a cauldron .
     [java] 
     [java] It hisses like a snake , growls like a carnivore and snaps out at its tormenter .
     [java] 
     [java] He stooped like a hunch-back .
     [java] 
     [java] Bissell howled then , like some kind of demented animal .
     [java] 
     [java] He wanted to howl like a dog and hear the echoes all around him .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he was running down the office , howling like a bereaved dog .
     [java] 
     [java] Did n't realise until it started howling like a demented banshee ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] Ruth tried not to show her terror when the timbers creaked and moaned like tormented spirits and she could hear the waves breaking on the deck above them .
     [java] 
     [java] After missing in a flat calm against the French , it was typical of Hastings that he succeeded in a gale which made the Murrayfield goal-posts moan like a didgeridoo .
     [java] 
     [java] The sailors all laughed at me because I walked and neighed like a horse .
     [java] 
     [java] Better than that was riding on his back while he went down on hands and knees and neighed like a horse .
     [java] 
     [java] The engine was purring like a tiger .
     [java] 
     [java] They darted about on the front of the group , their silver-leaf hair rustling like raw silk .
     [java] 
     [java] Screeching like a banshee , she was .
     [java] 
     [java] The wind screeched like a herd of pigs at slaughter .
     [java] 
     [java] God , thought Bykov , how can she snore like thunder yet sleep so lightly ?
     [java] 
     [java] The man snorted like a ploughhorse getting its breath after turning a long furrow .
     [java] 
     [java] She began to cry out , then sob like a child .
     [java] 
     [java] At Nice when he heard the devastating news that his Portuguese friend , the artist Amedeo de Sousa Cardoso , had died of Spanish flu he broke down and sobbed like a child .
     [java] 
     [java] My room was over the back door and it squeaked like a murdered rat .
     [java] 
     [java] Luney screwed up her face and her laughter squeaked like a party whistle .
     [java] 
     [java] The five Kenny children came crowding round like little goblins , dirty and ragged , but squealing happily .
     [java] 
     [java] She squealed like a tabby cat beneath the lecherous neighbourhood tom .
     [java] 
     [java] Against her yielding flesh she could feel his heart thundering like a man who had run a marathon .
     [java] 
     [java] Outside , standing on a beer barrel , a member of the ward watch rang a hand bell which tolled like a death knell through the noisy clamour of the place .
     [java] 
     [java] Then someone asked me where the station was , and she was deaf , and I had to trumpet like an elephant for about ten minutes .
     [java] 
     [java] She recalled the docks , and the way the sea screamed and wailed like a soul in torment , throwing itself against the piers with a wild vengeance that struck terror into her young heart .
     [java] 
     [java] I whimpered like a wounded puppy dog .
     [java] 
     [java] It reversed fast , the gearbox whining like a violin , and parked in front of the Mercedes .
     [java] 
     [java] He walked along the road , hands in pockets , whistling like a blackbird .
     [java] 
     [java] Cranston turned and quietly cursed as the madman scampered across the snow to greet them , yelping like an affectionate dog .
     [java] 
     [java] To Clare , his milky warm smell was like that of a newborn baby .
     [java] 
     [java] A sound like a bag of wet sulphur bursting in the middle of a bonfire .
     [java] 
     [java] Celebrated as the ex-mistress of Edward VII , as an international grande dame , and as a matchless hostess , Alice Keppel reigned like a queen over Florentine society .
     [java] 
     [java] The results , with one notable exception , were to make improvements to earlier discoveries like radar and jet propulsion , rather than to create totally new techniques or weapons .
     [java] 
     [java] The unavailability of Intel Corp 's promised Pentium chip is forcing hardware vendors like Unisys Corp , much of whose product line is Intel , to scramble .
     [java] 
     [java] ALTHOUGH the bond market generally has been yo-yoing with the fortunes of the Gulf war , one issue is selling like hot bagels .
     [java] 
     [java] The tar on the roads glistened like liquid quicksilver .
     [java] 
     [java] I can see her little gold necklace twinkling like a star round her neck .
     [java] 
     [java] Damian chose a huge square-cut emerald set in platinum that flashed like green fire against her finger .
     [java] 
     [java] He saw Ratagan 's axe flash like a star and bury itself in a hairy snout , splintering black blood .
     [java] 
     [java] He came on , walking in the same direction as Rachaela , the dilute snow sparkling in his hat like sequins .
     [java] 
     [java] At last , dripping wet , with water sparkling like jewels on her cheeks and forehead , and rivulets running from her hair , she stepped from the last stone on to the bank .
     [java] 
     [java] Golden rays beamed down like spotlights , transforming the charcoal water to sapphire-blue and making the streaks of foam sparkle like sugar frosting .
     [java] 
     [java] Her hair gleamed like a hastily polished brass pot , its tiny dents reddish brown .
     [java] 
     [java] His naked skin gleamed like gold in the morning sun .
     [java] 
     [java] She wore her hair low on the nape of her neck , its weight giving fragility to the long , slender throat , the chignon itself gleaming like spun silver .
     [java] 
     [java] From a wall niche , a pair of crystal decanters glittered like splinters of ice , and beneath them the object of my search , the pyx itself .
     [java] 
     [java] Swift and deadly , they are armoured in shining silver and armed with white lances with diamond-hard tips which glitter like stars .
     [java] 
     [java] The moon shone overhead like a new dime .
     [java] 
     [java] The oil-cloth that covered the kitchen table shone like new , except for cracked corners .
     [java] 
     [java] My well-worn schoolboy shoes were polished until they shone like glass .
     [java] 
     [java] as tall as a palm tree and perfectly black [ with ] one eye which flamed like a burning coal in the middle of his forehead .
     [java] 
     [java] Dot saw how the gold patterns on the cover caught the flicker from the fire and flared like Very lights .
     [java] 
     [java] When the London doctors finally granted him his freedom , he bolted like a child let out of school .
     [java] 
     [java] He would feel my hatred like a whip on his back .
     [java] 
     [java] His records are removed from their metal box and examined like moon rock .
     [java] 
     [java] They swarmed like lice over the camp , and there was a battle being waged at the boat which men were trying to push out of the shallows whilst others held off the beasts .
     [java] 
     [java]  Like ants over their nest they swarmed , black and confused .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's so time-consuming that most professional carvers avoid it like the plague . ''
     [java] 
     [java] As you know , the best commercial travel pictures avoid people like the plague .
     [java] 
     [java] I was babbling like an idiot . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He was sweating like a pig .
     [java] 
     [java] He growled and gibbered at them like a witch-hare and those nearest to him fell back in fear .
     [java] 
     [java] She was ranting like a maniac .
     [java] 
     [java] The bare road bisected it like a parting .
     [java] 
     [java] Last night she banged on her door , slurring her words like a drunk ; demanding to be let out , I thought .
     [java] 
     [java] Soon the chewed mass has sponged up any moisture left and your dry tongue is clanging against the side of your mouth like the great bell of Notre Dame .
     [java] 
     [java] He shook his head and clucked to himself like the White Rabbit in Alice .
     [java] 
     [java] Enough to squash Christine , and anyone else in the vicinity , against the wall like bugs .
     [java] 
     [java] As we came into view , hairy male legs moving like pistons beat a hasty retreat to the nearest available nook where they crouched and huddled in speechless terror .
     [java] 
     [java] The river flowed silently through the forest like blood through the body .
     [java] 
     [java] There was steam coming from beneath the bonnet of the stricken Audi , water gushing out like blood from a wound .
     [java] 
     [java] The limp ash from his cigarette gave up its struggle to defy the laws of gravity and cascaded like an avalanche down his tie , but O'Neill ignored it .
     [java] 
     [java] Aglow , the intruder radiated his own natural wavelengths luminously like some alien Eldar attired in a holo-suit .
     [java] 
     [java] However , in the end most people , including John Taylor , have come to the conclusion that black holes must radiate like hot bodies if our other ideas about general relativity and quantum mechanics are correct .
     [java] 
     [java] The protest issued from her lips like a cry of despair .
     [java] 
     [java] The bag was increasing its lead , almost out of view , when it arced and plummeted like a kite above the beach and was slammed against a rock .
     [java] 
     [java] A few heavy spots of rain were falling on the pavements like coins .
     [java] 
     [java] The dead King had been a lecher who lusted after other men 's wives , daughters , sisters , like a dog on heat .
     [java] 
     [java] Anthea stalked across the car park of Randall Lodge like a woman with a purpose .
     [java] 
     [java] He arched one foot like a cat 's back , and said , `` Aahh . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Laps of water slapped against the boat , like wine trickling from a bottle .
     [java] 
     [java] She skipped in circles round the silent chamber , her great head bobbing like a bird 's .
     [java] 
     [java] They walked into the sea to drown like lemmings , the people behind them climbing over the dead bodies that were heaping up on the sea-bed .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The decent people clapped like hell , and the rogues behaved themselves .
     [java] 
     [java] '' And she had this baby and it had a birthmark like a cat 's face on its stomach . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm trying to flap my arms like a duck and quack at the same time .
     [java] 
     [java] Cranston 's great fat hands flapped like the wings of a wounded bird and Athelstan saw the hurt in his eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] He would play all the characters like a one-man theatre .
     [java] 
     [java] So they tied him with chains but the demonic powers were so great in his life that he snapped them like new cords .
     [java] 
     [java] Brahmadaitya are kind to humans , though should one be foolish enough to chop down the palm tree where this spirit lives , the offender 's neck will be snapped , like a twig .
     [java] 
     [java] Drachenfels moved among them , laughing as he squeezed heads in his hands and shattered them like rotted fruits .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'd like to raze it and plough over the site like the Romans did with Carthage . ''
     [java] 
     [java] You should n't let him depress you like this . ''
     [java] 
     [java] His body tilted to horizontal , legs and arms hanging like a spider from a strand .
     [java] 
     [java] No one could doubt that William Joyce behaved like a young man who was English and proud of it .
     [java] 
     [java] The president is finely educated and is capable of talking like a professor and behaving like a despot .
     [java] 
     [java] But whether a significant proportion actually behave like Yuppies is another matter .
     [java] 
     [java] Few of them improve , and even fewer recover , many behave like members of cults , obeying their doctor without question , paying huge sums of money , and becoming estranged from their families .
     [java] 
     [java] They behaved towards each other like boys who had been educated at rival private schools .
     [java] 
     [java] In a league dominated by a restricted number of Canadian imports , home grown talent is craved like gold .
     [java] 
     [java] The rain crashed against the windows , and the wind screamed like an animal in the night .
     [java] 
     [java] and screaming like a gargoyle still
     [java] 
     [java] But I stooped like lightning and got the nail up and into my skirt pocket -- specially put on -- and I was standing exactly as he left me when he jumped back .
     [java] 
     [java] He sat up like a shot and his face was right over mine , blazing .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm not supposed to tell you , 'cos your father said as how we 'd all got to put it out of our heads , but '' she leaned down towards him , like a conspirator .
     [java] 
     [java] Angus slouched like a spoiled brat , nodded and began to tap noisily on the table top with his fingers .
     [java] 
     [java] I know it 's out of order , me coming here like this , but it 's urgent , could n't wait . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Everything came at you like a meteor , blasting out sound and colour and light .
     [java] 
     [java] She was seated in her chair like a cold stone statue , her face turned upward and away as an indication of her contempt .
     [java] 
     [java] The floor was covered with a black substance that looked like soot , but grated under the soles of her boots like sand .
     [java] 
     [java] She picked a saucepan off the cooker and raised it high , as if she might fling it across the kitchen like a hatchet .
     [java] 
     [java] His mother presses the sweets into his hand like someone handing blood plasma over in a war zone .
     [java] 
     [java] Redundant handles scrape along the ground like entrails and get tangled up in pushchair wheels and unsuspecting dogs ' legs .
     [java] 
     [java] Beth shut her eyes and opened her lungs , the scream reverberating round the house like the cry of a soul in torment .
     [java] 
     [java] Presently she heard a klaxon , two slight short blasts like a morse signal -- the stranger : Andrie , in person .
     [java] 
     [java] It was then that they heard the long awaited sound , a distant grinding hum like that of an angry wasp .
     [java] 
     [java] Charity gave a squeak like a startled sparrow , and dropped the binoculars so swiftly that the weight jerked uncomfortably on her neck .
     [java] 
     [java] `` You 're very kind , '' Eleanor repeated mechanically and followed Melissa from the church like a submissive child .
     [java] 
     [java] As Michael looked at the man sitting opposite , his fat ugly face grinning like a Cheshire cat 's , he felt an impulse to smash his fist into his teeth .
     [java] 
     [java] He grinned like a crocodile .
     [java] 
     [java] He was smiling like a happy demon , almost tenderly .
     [java] 
     [java] He would never have guessed that Kitty was rarely more than a dozen yards away from him , knowing he was the one who troubled Mary , shadowing him like a conscience .
     [java] 
     [java] Leafless twigs rapped their faces like bony knuckles .
     [java] 
     [java] Then the young woman laughed merrily , her voice strengthening after what must have been years of silence , and the whole strange cellar rang with that laughter , and the glass fragments tinkled like broken bells .
     [java] 
     [java] She lifted her hand to her immaculate hair , causing the many bracelets along her wasted arm to clank and clatter like old dustbin lids .
     [java] 
     [java] An overheated breeze came out of the desert , rattled the canvas sunscreen like a bad-tempered child seeking attention , and moved on , ignored .
     [java] 
     [java] Tug swung his arms like windmills .
     [java] 
     [java] He swung his head like an animal that suddenly intuits a reason for fear .

     [java] A few days beforehand , Jack Cornelius suggested a jaunt into the countryside to cheer us all up .
     [java] 
     [java] Gould 's letter to Prince , dispatched shortly after a two-day jaunt into the interior of the island of Tenerife , was apparently no less exhilarating .
     [java] 
     [java] Quigley leaped into the air like a monkey that has sat on a bunsen burner and gave a sort of primal grunt .
     [java] 
     [java] Eventually he limped into the channel , recovered his breath , and went back for more .
     [java] 
     [java] Just as the armies readied to set out , a battered ship limped into harbour .
     [java] 
     [java] Ed limped into the kitchen followed by his friend .
     [java] 
     [java] Five of the androids limped into the space between the doorway and the staircase , surrounding their captives .
     [java] 
     [java] Washed and bandaged , the dog limped into the village .
     [java] 
     [java] The two security men Dexter had interviewed immediately after the murder were on duty when the sergeant loped into the headquarters of TV London late that same afternoon .
     [java] 
     [java] He lumbered into the back of the truck , pulling himself up and over the tailboard .
     [java] 
     [java] The wind came so swiftly that within half an hour we were reducing sail , taking water over the deck , and beginning to lumber into a building seaway .
     [java] 
     [java] But while AT may be lunging into the Nineties , the corporate giant has not altogether abandoned the fashions of the previous decade .
     [java] 
     [java] It surges up the beach , still supported by the water of the dwindling wave , and with one powerful beat of its great tail , it lunges into a group of unsuspecting seal pups .
     [java] 
     [java] We have parents who seem to have lurched abruptly into grandparenthood , or who are nagging us to make them grandparents .
     [java] 
     [java] Though he had lurched into the kitchen like a drunken huntsman , he had known what to do .
     [java] 
     [java] I woke , cold and stiff , at 4am as the bus lurched into Maun .
     [java] 
     [java] The plane lurches into motion .
     [java] 
     [java] Waving the shears more dangerously , he lurched into the room .
     [java] 
     [java] LENNIE Lawrence 's army celebrated their march into football 's Premier Division amid a sea of red and white yesterday .
     [java] 
     [java] She marched into the hall and flung the front door open .
     [java] 
     [java] I MOSEYED into the NME offices bearing a still-throbbing psychic wound and a mittful of rejection letters .
     [java] 
     [java] Owen and Adam came running to meet the little priest as soon as he rode through the gate and paced wearily into the stable-yard .
     [java] 
     [java] Barefoot , she padded into her cramped kitchen and took a can of Coke from the refrigerator .
     [java] 
     [java] Still trembling , she got out finally and wrapped herself in a huge towel and padded into the kitchen to put the kettle on .
     [java] 
     [java] Securing her hair in a black band , she padded silently into the warmth of the night and headed for the pool .
     [java] 
     [java] Two horses came plodding into view , one a handsome chestnut with a startling blaze down its face and the other a grey , following behind .
     [java] 
     [java] But indoors meant her thoughts and Piers , neither of which she felt strong enough to endure , so she grimaced at the weather and resolutely plodded into the village , dripping over the telephone as she called the one and only astrologer listed in the directory .
     [java] 
     [java] Sylvia rushed into my room on the occasion of her first follow-up session , so anxious was she to get started on her treatment .
     [java] 
     [java] Dana sauntered into Claudia 's office during the afternoon .
     [java] 
     [java] A girl was sauntering into the hall .
     [java] 
     [java] About a mile upstream Ramses drew the boat into a side pool , scampered into the shallows and lashed the boat to a tree .
     [java] 
     [java] She and her friends scampered into the undergrowth where there were plenty of grubs for all .
     [java] 
     [java] The ball scooted into her goal for the ninth time , and Nick whooped with delight .
     [java] 
     [java] He got up , scrambled into his clothes , and chucked it in his wardrobe .
     [java] 
     [java] At their approach he scurried into a corner .
     [java] 
     [java] He scurried into the room and came up to them , smiling hopefully into their faces .
     [java] 
     [java] The runner soon returns and we all shuffle soggily into the hut .
     [java] 
     [java] The lodgers shuffle into line as if places were limited , like on a crowded bus .
     [java] 
     [java] A long moment later Herkimer Housebound , the ancient turtle , shuffled into view .
     [java] 
     [java] As they came up into the May morning he hopped over the ditch and skipped into the long grass as blithe as a squirrel .
     [java] 
     [java] The maids skipped into the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] The sandals had shiny soles with no grip and I can clearly remember skipping into the registry office and falling flat on my face .
     [java] 
     [java] He preferred more ambiguity and liked the idea of one or other of them sleepwalking accidentally into the other 's room ; that would have been less crude than prior agreements .
     [java] 
     [java] Slide through the front door , slink into the bedroom -- they know the flat now , remember -- ; and use a quiet knife , with one hand across the mouth to stop a dying scream .
     [java] 
     [java] Acknowledge people when you arrive rather than slinking into a corner .
     [java] 
     [java] Tealtaoich was not exactly padding into the forest and he was not precisely slinking into it either .
     [java] 
     [java] Feeling self-conscious at entering a pub by herself , she slunk into the Markham Arms , a glamorous tavern in the King 's Road where men-about-Chelsea relaxed in the evening .
     [java] 
     [java] I forgot everything I ever knew about standing up for myself and , without argument , I slunk meekly into the night .
     [java] 
     [java] Similarly , an otter slinking into a stream 100 metres away from a trout will not go unnoticed .
     [java] 
     [java] The credit card key slithers into a crack built into the door mantle .
     [java] 
     [java] Neck rope coiled round his waist , Trent slithered into the river like a crocodile .
     [java] 
     [java] If the accused helps himself to services , for example , by sneaking into a cinema when no one is looking , there is no obtaining by deception .
     [java] 
     [java] Enid had sneaked into Maud 's room for a quick conference about Mildred .
     [java] 
     [java] Often she crept out of her bed in the dead of night and sneaked into the new school hall to practise .
     [java] 
     [java] Now , why did you sneak into the village in such an underhand manner , instead of asking our permission ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] It was above me on the rocks , and then it sprang into the darkness behind me .
     [java] 
     [java] Whenever she was not concentrating on something else , it sprang into the foreground of her thoughts .
     [java] 
     [java] Finally , though , we staggered into the air .
     [java] 
     [java] I pushed back the rusty old gate and staggered into the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] Duncan briefed us on what was to take place and we staggered backwards into the harbour , barking like seals and standing on each others fins .
     [java] 
     [java] He clambered over the rubble and dropped to the uneven pavement , where he almost staggered straight into the water as his aching leg gave way .
     [java] 
     [java] He stamped his foot into his flying-boot .
     [java] 
     [java] The room erupted as first Harbury and then Riley stamped into the editor 's office .
     [java] 
     [java] She flushed and stamped into the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] A hundred years ago , this man had stamped into the Medici Palace in Florence and nearly wrecked the whole Trapezuntine expedition .
     [java] 
     [java] When no one answered her , she came stamping into the room with a scowl on her face .
     [java] 
     [java] In spite of this , those actors who stole into the auditorium between entrances returned full of enthusiasm .
     [java] 
     [java] He wanted to feel warmed through to his spine , to have the comfort steal into him like strong ale .
     [java] 
     [java] He washed and dressed quietly and stole into the kitchen , only to find Zelah making coffee .
     [java] 
     [java] A flicker of rebellion stole into her mind and , as if it had needed that impetus , one clear thought struggled free .
     [java] 
     [java] One thumb stole into her mouth , for comfort .
     [java] 
     [java] In these two species the parasite queen , all alone , steals into the nest of another ant species .
     [java] 
     [java] And on that note , we fold up our tents of correspondence and steal gladly into the night -- DQ
     [java] 
     [java] Twice Cantona stole into position at the far post waiting in vain for crosses .
     [java] 
     [java] Celia stole into his room one day while he was out at work .
     [java] 
     [java] He flicked a cassette player on the dashboard , and the soft , haunting strains of a ballad stole into the silence between them .
     [java] 
     [java] And yet , despite it all , I felt peace stealing into my soul .
     [java] 
     [java] The relaxed atmosphere of the sixth form was exploited to the full by Gedge and he made his first naive steps into a political arena , ones that ended at the school 's perimeter fence .
     [java] 
     [java] London-based Elonex Plc has taken its first step into the higher-end workstation market .
     [java] 
     [java] Is colourful as a rainbow , sturdy like a cabin , its beauty invites , step into my parlour .
     [java] 
     [java] Swinging lightly over the top rail he glanced down , measured the drop to the shoulders of his unsuspecting victim below , and stepped into space .
     [java] 
     [java] Each morning the members of the team come straggling into the dark and dusty offices , yawning and inert ; and each morning , as coffee is brought round and work gradually gets under way , the little enclosed world comes alive .
     [java] 
     [java] Driven beyond sense , she made no protest when he scooped her easily into his arms and strode deeper into the forest .
     [java] 
     [java] Like so many of Mr Murdoch 's gambles , the potential pay-off of his stroll into California 's Silicon Valley is enormous -- but too far away to help pay his debts today .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's a ten minute walk up hill from the beach and an easier stroll into the village .
     [java] 
     [java] Having parked his little plane , he strolled into the old shed , grandly titled the Airport Terminal , to get his paperwork sorted .
     [java] 
     [java] WE WERE just getting over the shock of seeing Arkle 's skeleton when this peacock strutted into the bar .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's 8 o'clock as Kenneth and I strut into Dr McKenzie 's consulting room for the results of the tests .
     [java] 
     [java] Israel and I pushed by the startled and helpless usher and swaggered into the arena dressed in our Mau Mau uniforms .
     [java] 
     [java] They swaggered into the casino leaving me to settle down to my sewing -- trousers for Lee -- within the confines of my little kiosk .
     [java] 
     [java] Jack was a common enough name , but the sound of it , and the touch of mystery associated with the call , made the image of a man swim into Doyle 's mind .
     [java] 
     [java] He suddenly swam into vocal range again .
     [java] 
     [java] These `` `` walls of death' '' may be 15 metres ( 50 feet ) deep , and they catch everything that swims into them .
     [java] 
     [java] He was in a positive cheerful mood this morning , and his mind was n't on the leg , so when the familiar hairy face swam into view he 'd acted without thinking .
     [java] 
     [java] But just at dawn you saw him tiptoe into your cell , carrying a straitjacket .
     [java] 
     [java] She woke late the next morning and washed in the cold water in the basin in her room and dressed hurriedly before tiptoeing into Patrick 's room .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Omi , '' she was about to tiptoe into that mysterious realm summed up by the word love when , maddeningly , the phone rang .
     [java] 
     [java] His mother tiptoed into the room .
     [java] 
     [java] I went on down the passage , towards the green baize door that closed the back premises off from the gentry 's quarters , pushed the door open , and trod tentatively into the front hall .
     [java] 
     [java] The high point of the whole trip for me came when seven of us trekked into the mountains to spend the night by a waterfall .
     [java] 
     [java] Members troop into lobbies at the beck of a party leader as though they have no minds to use .
     [java] 
     [java] She trotted into the living-room , where three bridge tables had already been set out , and peeped through the picture window .
     [java] 
     [java] Malhandir reached his master first and Tyrion vaulted into the saddle then turned to face his foes .
     [java] 
     [java] A FROGMAN waddled into a Swiss bank , snatched $20,000 , dived into a river to escape -- and was netted by cops following his bubbles .
     [java] 
     [java] Just then Bodger Badger , Lord Mayor of Riverbank , waddled into the crowd .
     [java] 
     [java] Early on in their set Axl Rose waded into the audience to pull a camera off someone and then stormed off stage .
     [java] 
     [java] Reinforcements were called and 25 police officers had to wade into the crowd to calm the situation .
     [java] 
     [java] Sara felt slightly sick , but there was no point in wading deeper into the morass .
     [java] 
     [java] Anyone who has waded into the clear blue waters of the Mediterranean without proper footwear may have encountered the protective covering of the sea urchins .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Right , '' I said , smiling , as they slid the straps of bright blue nylon knapsacks over their shoulders , `` we 'll take a walk into the Berkshire wilderness .
     [java] 
     [java] Northside have taken a trip from the street to the stage without appearing to stop off at the rehearsal room , and display no remorse at waltzing straight into the charts .
     [java] 
     [java] With the second half only four minutes old , Darren Tilly wriggled into the box and squared for Thaws who hit a low drive past Warner .
     [java] 
     [java] Defries was wriggling downwards into the corridor .
     [java] 
     [java] When he was a director of Sotheby 's he would bicycle into work each day .
     [java] 
     [java] Mary cycled into Berkeley 's ancient square and acknowledged a cheery greeting from `` Old Jesus , '' the bearded local tramp , who was resting on the Town Hall seat .
     [java] 
     [java] Once out of the bustling grimy city and on our way we motored into the heart of rural England , through expanses of green rolling hills with the odd kestrel hovering by the roadside looking for prey , and just as the sun began to set we passed Stonehenge , the strange stone monoliths eerily silhouetted against the dusky pink horizon .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Liam Devlin , if it is Devlin they choose , is hardly going to parachute into the courtyard at St Mary 's Priory tomorrow night , Jack , and if he did , so what ?
     [java] 
     [java] Squadrons parachute into simulated `` hostile '' territory .
     [java] 
     [java] McCready jumped down , pulled his bicycle to the ground , waved his thanks at the old farmer , and pedalled into town .
     [java] 
     [java] Late in the morning we rowed into the centre of the river .
     [java] 
     [java] For a long time he gazed into the depths of the rice , muttering .
     [java] 
     [java] And , as he smiled , he was gazing into the eyes of an extraordinarily beautiful dark-haired girl .
     [java] 
     [java] Perhaps imagine yourself in a cosy armchair , gazing into a log fire , stroking the cat on your lap and sipping a glass of dandelion wine .
     [java] 
     [java] His eyes gaze steadfastly into yours as you talk .
     [java] 
     [java] Stealing a furtive glance into the mirror , Frankie was shocked to see another face , another pair of eyes in the glass .
     [java] 
     [java] Lucy glanced into a couple of the rooms as they passed .
     [java] 
     [java] Jessica glanced into her face .
     [java] 
     [java] For one moment he looked into her eyes , then calmly she set down her cup upon the silver trolley , and with a murmur to the Grand Duchess rose to her feet .
     [java] 
     [java] A peek into someone 's kettle will reveal either a clean element or one coated with a white , chalky substance , depending on the local water type .
     [java] 
     [java] Carson took a peek into the brown paper on the Tube .
     [java] 
     [java] I had a quick peek into the kitchen but it was empty .
     [java] 
     [java] Lais ran through the villa peeking into rooms as she passed .
     [java] 
     [java] Tuppe peeped into the bag .
     [java] 
     [java] She peeped into the hall and drew back in shock .
     [java] 
     [java] Juliet peered into her fruit juice .
     [java] 
     [java] His mother was applying blue eyeshadow with a brush , drawing down her eyelids and peering into the mirror .
     [java] 
     [java] Robyn flicked open her eyes and peered into the night .
     [java] 
     [java] He paused for a second , staring into the fire .
     [java] 
     [java] Hiding near the door , I could just see into the kitchen through a small uncurtained window .
     [java] 
     [java] Through this hole I could see into the room next to the hut .
     [java] 
     [java] He dipped a spoon into the boeuf bourguignon .
     [java] 
     [java] She told me she did n't eat lunch any more as it had become a bourgeois meal , but I could call in for a cup of de-caff and con her into whatever it was I wanted .
     [java] 
     [java] `` What do you mean to do , '' demanded Harry , looking fiercely up at him from under drawn brows , `` now that you 've tricked me into this betrayal ?
     [java] 
     [java] In the late 1980s the Cubans manipulated them into a needless confrontation in Angola , which lasted much longer than it should have done because , this time , the Washington team was clumsier .
     [java] 
     [java] Or has Lester manipulated me into this recklessness , like a schoolboy dare ?
     [java] 
     [java] Yet he made no attempt to harass the driver into any illegitimate speed .
     [java] 
     [java] There was no evidence that Berowne had started his own meal -- that in itself might be of some help in deciding on the approximate time of death -- but he had apparently either cajoled Harry into the church with the promise of a meal or , more likely , had supplied an obvious and immediate need before he was ready for his own share of the supper .
     [java] 
     [java] I suspected that Fenella had bullied him into it .
     [java] 
     [java] He might have bullied her mother into submission , but those tactics were n't going to work on her any more .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a shed at the back , about forty yards away from the house , and two hundred yards beyond this , the steelworks began , black at first , then glowing into savage flames .
     [java] 
     [java] She jammed her fists into her pockets .
     [java] 
     [java] Claire jams the black box into her shoulder bag .
     [java] 
     [java] Donald jammed the shotgun into the crook of bone under Nathan 's jaw .
     [java] 
     [java] The younger of the trio looked at McCann and Morton and decided he would be better advised not to try and reach the .38 he had jammed into his belt .
     [java] 
     [java] The table was strewn with books and papers and candle-ends jammed into empty bottles , and the floor was similarly littered , but with boots and boxes .
     [java] 
     [java] The silencer jammed into the muzzle of the .45 made the weapon look enormous .
     [java] 
     [java] Girls , caught by the arm , have snow rubbed into their hair like salt into a herring .
     [java] 
     [java] 13:33 ) which causes the whole mixture to rise , or like salt rubbed into the meat to preserve and flavour it ( Luke 14:34 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] The animals ' food often contains toxic test substances or they may be forced to swallow huge capsules or have toxic creams rubbed into their raw skin .
     [java] 
     [java] So she crammed six big fellers into her front room , sat them down with rum and blankets , and the whole bunch snuggled up like they were queueing all night to buy tickets for the Test Match .
     [java] 
     [java] `` May -- '' he started to say , but I crammed a cushion into his mouth before he could finish .
     [java] 
     [java] `` This autobiography , '' Leo went on , cramming forks into the dishwasher .
     [java] 
     [java] This may have been the result of cramming so much into a restricted space , but it diminishes the significance of the book as a whole .
     [java] 
     [java] The contents of the saddle-bags he crammed into his wallet but there was more food than he could find room for .
     [java] 
     [java] As the English were forced back , their archers belatedly came into action , but showered more arrows into the backs of their own troops than into Bruce's .
     [java] 
     [java] His comrades , meanwhile , get to work with power drills and grinders , showering sparks into the front row and creating an industrial cacophony that mixes mysteriously with the piped classical backing track they 've picked to accompany their hellish instrumental .
     [java] 
     [java] Paul Falltrick at Falltricks used Salon Formula Volume Builder and Forming Mousse , both by Clynol , to shape the curls into this beautifully elegant style .
     [java] 
     [java] She unpacked quickly and changed from her travelling clothes into jeans and a warm sweatshirt , stopping to twist her unruly auburn curls into a topknot , then returned to Reception to ask for directions to the theatre .
     [java] 
     [java] `` That idiot Amanda '' , Hortensia said , `` has let her long hair grow even longer during the hols and her mother has plaited it into pigtails .
     [java] 
     [java] Here , a group of young Muslim girls in new mirror-work costumes were sitting cross-legged under the watchful eye of their father ; each one wore a tinsel hairband plaited into her pigtails .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1990 Alvarez was abducted from his home in Guadalajara by bounty hunters and smuggled into the USA where he was delivered to the DEA .
     [java] 
     [java] According to West Africa , diamond smuggling into Liberia from Sierra Leone had been estimated to yield about US$100 million annually , even before the conflict , and the mines were now a prime rebel objective .
     [java] 
     [java] True ; but the government has already decided that the fares charged wherever private railways have a near-monopoly ( for example , commuter lines into London ) will be regulated .
     [java] 
     [java] However , a faster alignment through a new King 's Cross station remains a possible alternative in spite of the opposition of the Treasury , which prefers a cheaper but roundabout line into St Pancras .
     [java] 
     [java] Once inside she wriggled into the corner of the seat to make room for him , and prepared to enjoy the novelty .
     [java] 
     [java] Hearing these words and seeing the speaker ride boldly toward him , the tiger was so alarmed that he turned tail and bolted into the forest .
     [java] 
     [java] We exited into a back alley via the fire door .
     [java] 
     [java] The mania persisted into the present century .
     [java] 
     [java] Unless there is a truly successful arrangement for the coordination of this teaching in schools , the current confusion will persist into the next generation .
     [java] 
     [java] A guard ushered them into the Beauchamp Tower and up into Mistress Philippa 's chamber on the second floor .
     [java] 
     [java] Lydia watched Betty ushering the guests into the cottage .
     [java] 
     [java] His cheerful rubicund face was graver than usual , and when she had ushered him into the dining-room he began without preliminary :
     [java] 
     [java] Catherine doubtfully puckered her lips when she saw the bedraggled red-eyed woman he ushered into her hallway , but her good nature got the better of her when she saw how badly Ixora was shivering .
     [java] 
     [java] The first birds we see are a group of turnstones and a redshank , busily feeding in the park below the house , probing into the area of damaged grass where my neighbour 's sheep are fed .
     [java] 
     [java] But what right had he to probe into her personal life ?
     [java] 
     [java] `` I was walking home from school and a masked man grabbed me and hauled me into a car .
     [java] 
     [java] In the end they hauled the Gnomes into a small ante-room across the galleried landing from the Sun Chamber .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I was walking home from school and a masked man grabbed me and hauled me into a car .
     [java] 
     [java] She looked very different from the girl who had hauled oysters into a sack and carried them to market .
     [java] 
     [java] We hauled our weary bodies into the kitchen and make token gestures towards having breakfast .
     [java]

     [java] Ronni kept her gaze fixed seawards as her stomach leapt inside her , remembering that dance they 'd shared together .
     [java] 
     [java] They 've gone , all those people who 've been marching around inside my head : Mum , Dad , teachers , infuriating old Brian -- even Cal who 's everyone 's friend when I 'm nobody 's friend but she 's special to me
     [java] 
     [java] `` Then he carried the little girl to the nearest building and rushed inside a flat to shower her with cold water .
     [java] 
     [java] He staggered back inside the house .
     [java] 
     [java] Some time between knocking on Nicolo 's door and stepping inside his apartment , she 'd lost the advantage her anger had provided .
     [java] 
     [java] He had not entered the room , but stood warily outside it , looking in at her , and before he would step inside he asked : `` He 's not home , then ?
     [java] 
     [java] The moment they stepped inside the Macandon offices , there was a flurry of activity around them .

     [java] At lunchtime Dot 's ears began hurting inside her head as though they were filling with hot fire .
     [java] 
     [java] If things were n't going badly enough , her feet hurt inside new shoes , and then he showed up .
     [java] 
     [java] As she grappled with the staples she could feel inside the bag the firm shape of a book .

     [java] 
     [java] The grain may be in a pocket , hidden inside a box , or out of sight above the horse on a bird table .
     [java] 
     [java] She curled her fingers around the shard in her palm , slipped it back into the thin pouch of cotton hidden inside the skirts of her dress .
     [java] 
     [java] There had been a great Victorian pile of a hospital there then , maybe still was unless they had demolished it , its chimney concealed inside a mock campanile .
     [java] 
     [java] There are two external zipped hip pockets , both with storm flaps , and a map pocket concealed inside the jacket .
     [java] 
     [java] Just now work seemed the best antidote to the frustration that was boiling inside her .
     [java] 
     [java] What volcano of emotion must have been boiling inside that youngster under his teasing and laughing , under his occasionally expressionless face ?
     [java] 
     [java] The desire burning inside her was too strong , and she returned his kiss , hearing him moan at her response .
     [java] 
     [java] The flame that had been burning inside her since their first kiss burst suddenly into flame .
     [java] 
     [java] She gave a jerky nod , trying to combat her jealousy , knowing it was unreasonable , unjust , yet feeling it burn inside her , unstoppable and intolerable .
     [java] 
     [java] But the enthusiasm which burned inside Imre Pozsgay when he joined the party at the age of 17 has been extinguished by the bitter experiences of the past 40 years .
     [java] 
     [java] The violence seethed inside him , like milk bubbling in a saucepan , trying to boil over and escape the unendurable heat .
     [java] 
     [java] Anger simmered inside her .
     [java] 
     [java] Abruptly , unexpectedly the anger simmering inside her reached boiling point .
     [java] 
     [java] With so many confused emotions simmering away inside you , it 's difficult to know where to turn .
     [java] 
     [java] Oh , Andre was always a hit with the girls , and he did have a certain effeminate appeal and a wonderful way with words , but he lacked Piers 's vitality , the vibrant sexuality that seemed to smoulder away inside him .
     [java] 
     [java] Gabriel knelt up inside the cart and peered out to see what would happen .
     [java] 
     [java] If an insect walks by , she grabs it and instantly drags it inside the tunnel .

     [java] 
     [java] Fabia got out , then found that before she could say a word , Ven was escorting her inside the hotel and waiting with her while she collected her room key .
     [java] 
     [java] According to the initial agreement , any foreign warship putting into the port was to be greeted by a Polish warship and escorted inside the port canal for an exchange of courtesies .
     [java] 
     [java] And she led them inside her house and through to her kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] There were a few frantic seconds while the owl went berserk around my head before disappearing inside its box .
     [java] 
     [java] Time to depart , Creed concluded as Kevin disappeared inside the cottage .
     [java] 
     [java] Trent felt her retreat further inside herself as he shouted through the organ howl , `` There 's a chance we can make our way upriver . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Arthur retreated inside the house , motioning Coffin to follow .
     [java]

     [java] `` Planets move in ellipses around the sun '' is more precise than `` Planets move in closed loops around the sun '' , and is consequently more falsifiable .

     [java] In the garden the leaves shone in the sunlight , and the flowers moved gently in the summer wind .
     [java] 
     [java] He noticed that they continually moved in a zigzag fashion .

     [java] 
     [java] On cosmology he generally followed Tycho Brahe , whose scheme he reproduced in diagrammatic form .
     [java] 
     [java] This piece was inspired by Turner 's paintings of Venice and Osborne attempts to reproduce in music some of the artist 's preoccupations with spectral lights refracted in the special atmosphere of the city .
     [java] 
     [java] We demand that our work should be recognised for what it is -- we produce and reproduce in other people and ourselves the ability to work and go on working , we produce labour power .
     [java] 
     [java] The problem to date has been that the colours seen on the display monitor are difficult to reproduce accurately in the final dyed or printed product : what you see is not always what you get !
     [java] 
     [java] He showed little interest in the CPRS , but was happy enough to keep it and sent Lord Rothschild a chirpy Prime Minister 's personal minute on 1 April 1974 which Rothschild reproduced in his Random Variables :
     [java] 
     [java] Dirt found in the craquelure and in the wood beneath in genuine fifteenth-century paintings would be hard to reproduce in a recent version .
     [java] 
     [java] So we 've combined them in a shampoo that makes dry hair lustrous and more manageable .
     [java] 
     [java] Oriental wisdom was thus unified in a genealogical tree in which the Jews were the descendants of the Persian wise men .
     [java] 
     [java] The `` twin' villages were officially united in 1935 as Newbald civil parish .
     [java] 
     [java] The reason that so many different interest groups , with their contrasting standpoints , can apparently unite in this way is obvious enough .
     [java] 
     [java] Split the cake in half horizontally and sandwich together again with some of the buttercream .
     [java] 
     [java] So they decided to split the house in two . ''

     [java] Cassowary blinked in astonishment .
     [java] 
     [java] Patrick blinked in astonishment .
     [java] 
     [java] Father Poole blinked in dismay .
     [java] 
     [java] Rory blinked in surprise .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] To the first verse everyone claps in time with the music .
     [java] 
     [java] When the number ended he clapped in a careful way , unconsciously trying.to say exactly what he felt about it .

     [java] Stringer cocked a thumb in Morgan 's direction .
     [java]

     [java] He released her and sat back , flexing his legs in the confines of the car .
     [java] 
     [java] Milton flung himself in his chair and buried his head in his hands .

     [java] 
     [java] Swod stared at her , unblinking , lifting a hand in a gesture of patience .
     [java] 
     [java] Miguelito lifted his eyebrows in amazement at Trent 's stupidity : `` Hey , you think Louis the big Jefe ?
     [java] 
     [java] Father Devlin nodded in agreement .
     [java] 
     [java] She nodded in concern .
     [java] 
     [java] Blanche nodded in a conciliatory way .
     [java] 
     [java] Merry pursed her lips in a silent whistle .
     [java] 
     [java] `` And is there , '' the Substitute pursed his lips in a smile and drew on his cigar , `` a brother in the case ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] The French boy pursed his lips suddenly in an expression of disgust .
     [java] 
     [java] The Doctor pursed his lips in thought .
     [java] 
     [java] `` She 's a shy little girl who needs friends to bring her out of herself ! '' their elders had protested , shaking their heads in exasperation at the thoughtlessness of the younger generation .
     [java] 
     [java] His friend Okawi had signalled to the other canoes by gently shaking his thumb in the direction of the sleeping animals .
     [java] 
     [java] Patrick shrugged in embarrassment .
     [java] 
     [java] The slender shoulders shrugged in irritation .
     [java] 
     [java] John shrugged in resignation and disgust .
     [java] 
     [java] Despite fitzAlan 's assurances that she would n't encounter a corpse , she held her breath with trepidation every time she swung her free hand in a groping semicircle .
     [java] 
     [java] He sheathed the hologram blade , then , with a hand pressed against the bunched shoulder muscles , swung his left arm in a wide overhead circle .
     [java] 
     [java] As we reached the shore of the island Maha threw her hands in the air , clasping them in a boxer 's sign of victory .
     [java] 
     [java] He extended his arm fully and began to waggle it in an arc across the faces of the congregation .
     [java] 
     [java] People stand on their heads and wiggle their feet in the air .
     [java] 
     [java] Antonio winked in Stephen 's direction .
     [java] 
     [java] Marie-Christine wrinkled her nose in a small comic grimace .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Everything okay ? '' he said , and she wrinkled her nose in disgust and then smiled .
     [java] 
     [java] Nora Fanshawe wrinkled her nose in distaste .
     [java] 
     [java] He wrinkled his nose in distaste at the acrid smell of the place .
     [java] 
     [java] She was clutching something in her right hand , something covered in white powder , as she weaved towards us and sat down heavily and out of breath .
     [java] 
     [java] The Welsh international clutched his head in his hands fearing the worst -- and it happened .
     [java] 
     [java] I leant against the mulberry tree clutching Radish in my fist and had a bit of a cry there .
     [java] 
     [java] She held out her right hand awkwardly , still clutching the briefcase in the other .
     [java] 
     [java] With a shrill yelp she nipped him in the hind leg and he shot away in alarm .
     [java] 
     [java] She nudged him playfully in the ribs with her elbow .
     [java] 
     [java] He nudged Cripple Wa in the ribs , and pointed wordlessly .
     [java] 
     [java] `` This is difficult , very difficult , '' said one Bosnian soldier as he crouched in a trench about to sprint across open ground under the sights of Serb gunners .
     [java] 
     [java] I tried to start the engine but the airman on the starter battery trailer had fled so I could not do a thing except huddle in the cockpit , waiting for the sensation of being hit .
     [java] 
     [java] The animals huddled in a corner , shaking with fear .
     [java] 
     [java] Dozens of Pakistanis , Indians and Turks huddle in groups on the pavement , stamping their feet against the cold .
     [java] 
     [java] The big Han knelt in the doorway and bowed his head .
     [java] 
     [java] As I kneel in a kind of mourning , someone calls .
     [java] 
     [java] Her greatest dread , however , was that the vicar might suggest that , together , he and Olivia should kneel in prayer .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Did the doctor say how long I must lie in my bed ? '' he asked .
     [java] 
     [java] Cowley sat stiffly in one of the leather armchairs , not at all happy with what Hogan had just told him .
     [java] 
     [java] I sat in the passenger seat and nursed my plaster cast .
     [java] 
     [java] Remember to carry yourself well -- it is so easy to slouch in an off-duty moment .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's cos they do n't sit in the seat properly , they slouch in them !
     [java] 
     [java] Ratagan sprawled in a chair , his long legs crossed in front of him .
     [java] 
     [java] Rachel and Chas sprawled in undignified positions on the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] She made out the shape of Caro squatting in the armchair , rigidly still .
     [java] 
     [java] We squat in silence .
     [java] 
     [java] Connon stood in the door .
     [java] 
     [java] She stood in the kitchen doorway .
     [java] 
     [java] They stood in the middle of the road as we approached cautiously .
     [java] 
     [java] A man was standing in the shadow behind the front door .
     [java] 
     [java] What made this interesting is that the company I work for has considerable knowledge in this area .
     [java] 
     [java] The children discover a great hole in the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] Police discovered the Mini van in the warehouse in the nearby City Walls Road while carrying out a systematic search of the whole city .
     [java] 
     [java] He was going to take me to the derelict chateau he and Montaine had discovered in a clearing in one of the forests .
     [java] 
     [java] The facts you discovered in the last paragraph are very important and should be learnt .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It 's not every day I find a mermaid in the bath . ''
     [java] 
     [java] When there 's no racing nearby , you 'll find him in the Garrick Club . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It was clear that she had not expected to find him in the room .
     [java] 
     [java] With an assortment of adjectives , the driver confirmed , and his fireman noted a determined glint in his mate 's eye .
     [java] 
     [java] The miners became geologists within their domains , noting alterations in the vein and the country-rock and studying forerunners of richness or poverty .
     [java] 
     [java] Two races of the Golden Plover are regularly noted in Sussex , P. a. apricaria and P. a. altifrons .
     [java] 
     [java] These symptoms may be difficult to recognize in a patient after anaesthesia .
     [java] 
     [java] He had smugly recognized in Patricia symptoms of what he was pleased to term an adolescent crush on himself .
     [java] 
     [java] But inference from context would rule out such an interpretation in this story .
     [java] 
     [java] Accreditation was not a concept that had gained currency in Britain at this time , and in developments over the next few years it was to receive a variety of interpretations in British further and higher education .
     [java] 
     [java] Not only did these girls experience and perceive the juvenile court in a different way , they were expected and advised by their solicitors to play a different role from boys :
     [java] 
     [java] Written forms , they argue , enable the user to differentiate such functions in a way less possible in oral language .
     [java] 
     [java] Among the weaknesses revealed in the report was the lack of planning in the school 's curriculum for children between Primary One and Primary Three -- for which Mrs Cochrane was responsible .
     [java] 
     [java] Particularly insidious is the unobtrusive process of grooming for partnership , as revealed in the survey .
     [java] 
     [java] My guilty passion made me admire her in everything she said or did .
     [java] 
     [java] Devious himself , he admired the same quality in her .
     [java] 
     [java] Over the short distance , though , I 'm pretty impressive , and I admire the same quality in others .
     [java] 
     [java] What he admired in Niki was his capacity to wrest the best out of whatever situation he was in : that , James said , was the mark of the champion .
     [java] 
     [java] So there was much to admire in William , bastard son of Duke Robert of Normandy , whose ancestors and Thorfinn 's were the same .
     [java] 
     [java] You appreciate the modelling in faces .
     [java] 
     [java] But I still appreciate good manners in men .
     [java] 
     [java] What did your father appreciate most in the work of Modigliani ?
     [java] 
     [java] There was undisguised contempt in his voice .
     [java] 
     [java] There was an icy contempt in her voice , and his face darkened in anger before he gave a faint dismissive shrug of his broad shoulders .
     [java] 
     [java] Trouserless men looked absurd in socks .
     [java] 
     [java] Bannister is candid in his views , vivid and thorough in his description , generous and perceptive in his praise of his colleagues and astute in his own observations .
     [java] 
     [java] Women have proved to be astute in business .
     [java] 
     [java] A badly constructed letter , crude in style , vague in wording and careless in grammar , will create an unfavourable impression , whereas a well framed letter , clear and concise in wording , indicates efficiency .
     [java] 
     [java] The seventeenth-century poet Robert Herrick thought that a little carelessness in appearance was actually very exciting :
     [java] 
     [java] The ruling class , by contrast , was ruthless and cynical in its resort to violence .
     [java] 
     [java] The Vendor should be diligent in their disclosures .
     [java] 
     [java] At first glance , such precise and long-winded accounts of restorations , alterations and embellishments might indicate that Mr Frick employed limited discernment in his choice of purchases , but this is definitely not the case .
     [java] 
     [java] Grant that the audiovisual media which nourish your gifts of hearing , speech and sight , may serve for growth in wisdom and discernment in all your people .
     [java] 
     [java] The capacity to make sophisticated discernment in thought-processes is within the grasp of almost everyone and constantly demonstrated in everyday life .
     [java] 
     [java] How could a man so intelligent in every other way be so obtuse when it came to ordinary everyday living ?
     [java] 
     [java] He could be shrewd in analysis , as when he told Eden that if war came `` the country will want [ Churchill ] to lead them '' , but that Eden 's chances were better in peace .
     [java] 
     [java] Bromhead was shrewd in his advice and generous in his support .
     [java] 
     [java] He was shrewd in personal assessments .
     [java] 
     [java] Shrewd in business , he had a ready wit and a distinctive appearance , with a full beard and piercing eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] Shrewd in the transfer market and refreshingly frank in his public pronouncements , Lennie has been the signing of the season .
     [java] 
     [java] Clementi , too , was shrewd in business .
     [java] 
     [java] The next two chapters examine this problem in more detail .
     [java] 
     [java] Neither was I told to examine in minute detail , every blade of grass that my kit was to come in contact with .
     [java] 
     [java] `` They 're all Copts , '' said Nikos , but went to look in his files .
     [java] 
     [java] For details of the series look in the Radio Times or get a list of the programmes , either from Radio Brighton or by writing to me , Doctor Brian Smith at the Physics Building in the university .
     [java] 
     [java] She stopped and looked at the other three who were scrutinising her in amused silence .
     [java] 
     [java] Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have found documents mentioning red mercury during their searches in Baghdad .
     [java] 
     [java] The dog should return within a few minutes , but if not , search in the direction where you last saw your pet .
     [java] 
     [java] It should not restrict pupils from searching in other directions .
     [java] 
     [java] I slowed down as I approached Colcutt village , searching in the glove box for something more soothing than Tina Turner .
     [java] 
     [java] He had reached the corner of his street and was searching in his pocket for his key , when a dark figure came out of the shadows and crossed the road towards him .
     [java] 
     [java] She searched in her overall pocket .
     [java] 
     [java] Bull searched in his pockets for a cigarette .
     [java] 
     [java] Bloomfield writing long after `` The Deserted Village '' is much more explicit in his critique of wealth than are Duck and Leapor .
     [java] 
     [java] Bedu translated the Classes into French and English , but was so explicit in her demonstrations that it was not always necessary .
     [java] 
     [java] Earlier , Mandela had been forthright in his criticism of US support for the Angolan rebel movement UNITA .
     [java] 
     [java] And , Francis was frank in the reasons for the substitution when he said : `` I felt at that moment something different was needed .
     [java] 
     [java] He watched her , frank in his longing .
     [java] 
     [java] Shrewd in the transfer market and refreshingly frank in his public pronouncements , Lennie has been the signing of the season .
     [java] 
     [java] Nevertheless , he was clinically frank in his analysis of his side 's shortcomings on Saturday night .
     [java] 
     [java] But she could not help reflecting that Araminta , with all her faults , was at least honest in her dealings with her mother .
     [java] 
     [java] Not only were viewers outspoken in their complaints but the athletics writers , who rely on TV coverage , were quick to point out that the London Marathon is not one of the BBC 's happiest events .
     [java] 
     [java] Campeanu was outspoken in his criticism of the idea that dollars channelled through private corporations should be accepted .
     [java] 
     [java] He has often been outspoken in his differences with the government .
     [java] 
     [java] They show that he was thoroughly sincere in his acceptance of collegiality .
     [java] 
     [java] It was felt that the government was not sincere in the implementation of community care because they mention community care in the same breath as cutbacks .
     [java] 
     [java] On the other hand , are they sincere in their praise ?
     [java] 
     [java] Thus , we can not predict social events with absolute certainty and have to couch our forecasts in terms of probabilities , provided other factors do not change , which of course they can .
     [java] 
     [java] These movements found expression in the Reports of the Maud Committee and the Bains Committee respectively .
     [java] 
     [java] She felt Johnny 's body stiffen , and the mellow , languid expression in his eyes was replaced by something infinitely less comforting .
     [java] 
     [java] Since then she had seen many different expressions in his eyes : amusement , surprise , speculation , even respect .
     [java] 
     [java] Matthew Preston 's voice was still pleasant , but the expression in his eyes hardened a little .
     [java] 
     [java] States formulate their policies in a moral language only when it suits them and only in whatever form best cloaks and serves their interests .
     [java] 
     [java] Surely , speakers and writers aiming at optimal relevance would formulate their utterances in a way that guaranteed the intended interpretation in the first place .
     [java] 
     [java] Without attempting here to formulate such a scheme in any comprehensive way I propose to consider some of the important elements which would enter into it .
     [java] 
     [java] If it chooses to interfere , it can formulate its decision in the words : `` The court below had no jurisdiction to decide this point wrongly as it did . ''
     [java] 
     [java] This did not fit with the idea of `` collaborative activities '' which we had set out with because we had formulated our questions in terms of the teacher 's decision making .
     [java] 
     [java] In fact , during the war years such views received their most consistent and sophisticated formulation in the pages of Scrutiny .
     [java] 
     [java] I framed my remarks in a hypothetical context following on from delegation to the regional arts boards , and I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was not there to listen and to learn .
     [java] 
     [java] For these reasons , we chose a semi-structured interview format in which we specified the key topic areas to be discussed but framed the questions in an open-ended fashion .
     [java] 
     [java] A second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant 's conduct .
     [java] 
     [java] An economist would frame this question in terms of a cost--benefit analysis : the maximisation of returns for the minimum amount of effort injected .
     [java] 
     [java] Or , to phrase the question in a Kantian style , what are the '' conditions of its possibility '' ?
     [java] 
     [java] The crucial question on secondary picketing is the definition of the wording in Labour 's policy document : '' where there is a direct interest between two groups of workers of an occupational or professional nature '' .
     [java] 
     [java] 0404.2 The appropriate FSA wording in the disclaimer
     [java] 
     [java] The Commission was asked to answer a question in writing .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Recently there has been a spate of allegations in the media about the business affairs of both me and my family , which shows no sign of abating .
     [java] 
     [java] For the Americans it was the first declaration in a film that love for pleasure is not sin .
     [java] 
     [java] If you really have refused Fred Pendlebury , I shall make my own declaration in the proper form and- '' with a stern glance at Agnes -- `` at a moment of my choosing . ''
     [java] 
     [java] That had been in a train like this one , a Jubilee train heading northwards , and Jarvis could clearly remember the man 's despair , his shouts and exclamations in a language no one understood .
     [java] 
     [java] It was condemned by the English bishops , who found twenty-nine heretical propositions in it .
     [java] 
     [java] Without this single find in a remote country we should only have doubtful knowledge , from some remarks in Herodotus , of archaic decorative metal-work on this scale .
     [java] 
     [java] From some remarks in Sir Alfred Ayer 's autobiography ( Part of my Life Vol. 1 , 1978 ) , it seems that the two met infrequently and perhaps did not altogether get on .
     [java] 
     [java] The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed ( Mr. Beith ) made some generous remarks in his speech about my visit to his constituency , for which I was grateful .
     [java] 
     [java] I must admit to being somewhat taken aback by a remark in John Stewart 's letter about Gaelic `` being almost completely unrelated to any of the main European languages '' ( Points of View , today ) .
     [java] 
     [java] The percentage of all rape cases reported in our sample of newspapers increased from a steady 25 per cent over the two decades , 1951 to 1971 , to very nearly 40 per cent in 1978 .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm disappointed in you !
     [java] 
     [java] I was never more disappointed in anyone .
     [java] 
     [java] Brearley was bitterly disappointed in Firths ' reaction to his innovation .
     [java] 
     [java] The fatherly cop is disappointed in me .
     [java] 
     [java] I was a bit disappointed in those Laura Ashley dresses , they were to tight for a start .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I adore Vitor in his driver 's overalls , '' she had declared , giggling .
     [java] 
     [java] Surely there could n't be other women who delighted in such anguish .
     [java] 
     [java] But Mary was delighting quietly in the atmosphere of freedom .
     [java] 
     [java] Feminists ca n't blame it all on men -- since time began , men have delighted in our wobbly bits , thank heaven .
     [java] 
     [java] The book delights in combat , squirming with pleasure and letting out little gasps and moans of delight as adrenalin races through the character 's body .
     [java] 
     [java] It was Francis with his head back laughing , inhaling all the joy of the world ; Francis delighting in the flowers he threw together with branches and invited me to enjoy .
     [java] 
     [java] We learn to delight in God alone .
     [java] 
     [java] The girls groaned over this , except the quick ones like Irene who delighted in it , but it meant that there was no need for anyone to open the desk because it was all oral work .
     [java] 
     [java] But I do n't hate Englishness in any way .
     [java] 
     [java] They reached the entrance in mutual silence and , seething in mounting outrage , she was propelled inside .
     [java] 
     [java] Anger has been simmering in SDLP ranks since DUP leader Ian Paisley and Mr Campbell both criticised the party 's `` power-sharing '' policy in the run-up to last week 's election .
     [java] 
     [java] The fires of fury and hatred were smouldering in her small black eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] Ratagan said nothing , though fire still smouldered in his cavernous eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] And why should it , he reflected , when a sullen anger smouldered in him still ?
     [java] 
     [java] She felt that all compassion must have passed from Emilia with the emptying of her womb except for this last residue that smouldered in the promise she exacted now .
     [java] 
     [java] Christine let him stew in it for a few moments .
     [java] 
     [java] She could stew in her own juice .
     [java] 
     [java] Give it to me , Lori , or so help me I will go to the police and let you stew in your own juice . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Two of the sons of one of the '' suspects '' died in a bomb explosion shortly after the abduction , and Lebanese police claimed that Israeli forces had planted the bomb during the raid .
     [java] 
     [java] Then in June , Ivan died in a freak fire at his seafront nursing home .
     [java] 
     [java] This is often much more damaging to the self-esteem of the farm worker than the arrival in the village of alien newcomers with whom he does not identify .
     [java] 
     [java] In Washington , President Carter was delighted that the Shah 's arrival in the states would be further delayed .
     [java] 
     [java] Whether they have just arrived in this country , or speak little English or have difficult home circumstances , unless we see them as competent learners we will soon find reasons why they can not learn .
     [java] 
     [java] He 's due to arrive in New York tonight for an official three-day visit . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He had been hiding out , sleeping rough , until three days ago when he arrived in Paris to look up another man indebted to him .
     [java] 
     [java] Madge stretched out a hand and said soothingly , `` Please come in Mr Patel .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Wilhelm wo n't speak to me since I chucked his Filofax in the jacuzzi .
     [java] 
     [java] You can chuck me in the river , if you like , for all the good I am to meself .
     [java] 
     [java] Milton flung himself in his chair and buried his head in his hands .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , in the very same breath , she snatched up the toppled coffee-cup and flung the lukewarm contents in his face .
     [java] 
     [java] When he came round , they dragged him outside and flung him in his night-clothes , into a car and handcuffed him .
     [java] 
     [java] Young Jack flung his darts in such rapid succession that they were nothing more than a triple blur .
     [java] 
     [java] Speechless with rage , Mait hurled the card in the Doctor 's face before storming out of the cell .
     [java] 
     [java] So I nudged Martin in the direction of a mindless blonde divorcee .
     [java] 
     [java] He pressed his thumb in the hollow of one of her cheeks and circled it , rubbing it abrasively over her trembling lips .
     [java] 
     [java] When she saw where I was sitting she pushed her hands in her coat pockets and ambled over on her shaky heels .
     [java] 
     [java] Every time there was a call , although 99 times out of a 100 the call was for him , he pushed the phone in my direction .
     [java] 
     [java] This cross is then pushed upwards in the direction of the attacker 's fist , which becomes trapped in the `` V '' between the defender 's fists .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he shoved the letter in his jacket pocket and stood .
     [java] 
     [java] He shoved my shirt in my mouth first , so I would n't make a noise . ''
     [java] 
     [java] She had heard the cops on Plenty did n't even bother throwing you in jail .
     [java] 
     [java] And once he had heard Sweetheart coming down the stairs , her high-heels ringing on the stone steps , and he had thrown the stolen food in Rosie 's corner in a panic .
     [java] 
     [java] They tipped the contents of one oil drum into the car and threw in a burning rag .
     [java] 
     [java] He reckoned he had done well to get away with two cups of tea and forty minutes of reminiscence before an opening arose to thrust in a question .
     [java] 
     [java] At the station I pick up my other parcel from Left Luggage , and toss it in a holdall .
     [java] 
     [java] And animals with horns have sometimes managed to toss their tormentors high in the air when making a last-ditch stand .
     [java] 
     [java] Toss the potatoes in the butter , spoon into a warmed serving dish and garnish with more sprigs of basil .
     [java] 
     [java] That way , when you bust your board , you do n't just toss it in the garbage .
     [java] 
     [java] All they had to do was pile the earth back on top of the coffin and toss in a few bulbs of garlic just to be on the safe side .
     [java] 
     [java] After the execution Lady Betty would accompany the corpse in a cart to the market square where two tall poles had been erected .
     [java] 
     [java] However the crash crew person asked the instructor to accompany her in the fire vehicle , and on arrival at the vehicle they asked a bystander to raise the alarm .
     [java] 
     [java] Her husband chased us in a jeep , and the oscillations of the basket told him what I was doing to his wife , and the poor man was jealous . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Then there was the strangeness of Siouxsie , leading us in circles , nowhere in particular .
     [java] 
     [java] It was a potentially dangerous operation involving 15 armed police officers , 2 of which had tracked the car in the force helicopter .
     [java] 
     [java] The police had prohibited any confrontation at the game , so the Bushwackers tracked their intended quarry in their cars , communicating with each other on CB-radio ( Observer , 2 June 1985 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] So the following afternoon , as soon as Mrs Wormwood had departed in her car for another session of bingo , Matilda set out for Fred 's house to investigate .
     [java] 
     [java] Robert , Herluin , Hugh and the stranger departed in the direction of the abbot 's lodging , where Radulfus had already come out to greet them .
     [java] 
     [java] The Javanese dignitaries , who would have disapproved of the suggestion , were already stirring to depart in their jeeps for Makassar to catch their plane home .
     [java] 
     [java] The swifts will depart in the first week of August .
     [java] 
     [java] Moments which we would like to savour disappear in a flash and moments which embarrass us seem interminable .
     [java] 
     [java] But while the French did not feel encouraged to emigrate in large numbers , the 50,000 inhabitants of New France moved inland much more boldly than the Abbe Prevost might have made one expect .
     [java] 
     [java] Her laughter escaped in little gusts and rushes .
     [java] 
     [java] All three men escaped in a red Metro car .
     [java] 
     [java] The otter has no alternative but to retreat in agony and attempt to prize the claws free .
     [java] 
     [java] The artillery bombardment was such that the starving and bewildered Russians could not withstand it ; they retreated in disorder over the frontier .
     [java] 
     [java] Such cries should not cause feminist liturgists to retreat in fear .
     [java] 
     [java] The Bolivian poet excused herself , vanishing in the direction of the toilets .
     [java] 
     [java] The town forced the army to withdraw in December 1990 , after soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration , killing 13 villagers , including a nine-year-old boy .
     [java] 
     [java] Under a UN agreement , the Soviet forces , who had lost 14,000 dead , withdrew in 1989 .
     [java] 
     [java] When the troops withdrew in October , the anti-treaty Nez Perce met in council at Tepahlewam ( Split Rocks ) , an age-old meeting place on Camas Prairie .
     [java] 
     [java] We put it to bed in a bowl and cover it in bulb fibre like a blanket .
     [java] 
     [java] One girl wanted to cover him in whipped cream and honey and then slowly lick off every bit .
     [java] 
     [java] Occasionally a small coin clattered in his tin .
     [java] 
     [java] He glared up at Liartes , who was beginning to descend in wide sweeps .
     [java] 
     [java] Above us the fronds of the palm trees clattered in the warm wind , while out to sea Bonefish 's ragged and patched sail dipped in the steep waves beyond the reef .
     [java] 
     [java] Or cravenly deposit it in a bin ?
     [java] 
     [java] Jarman would then take the man 's belongings , deposit the body in a nearby river and sell his horse and clothes to the taciturn gypsies that wandered the moor .
     [java] 
     [java] He removed her hands from his person and deposited them in her lap .
     [java] 
     [java] Extraposition involves changing the position of the entire clause in the sentence by , for instance , embedding a simple clause in a complex sentence .
     [java] 
     [java] But , while these points may be reasonable , and some of them may be true , this attempt to embed them in a general theory or schema seems unhelpful .
     [java] 
     [java] Although concerned to embed his ideas in practices Bourdieu is not himself especially concerned with defining the role of the artefact , but it is clear how his work contributes to such a task .
     [java] 
     [java] The fig tree embeds its multitudes of seeds in globes of sweet pulp .
     [java] 
     [java] Multi media gives us the ability to be able to embed pictures in text .
     [java] 
     [java] Previously they had to remove embers from the long fire-pit to lay on corrugated metal sheets , then embed the breadpans in the cinders and replace the hot sheets over the hole .
     [java] 
     [java] If it is impractical to embed the header in the text of a piece of software , e.g. in object modules or indexed files , LIFESPAN provides an alternative way of bringing such software under its control .
     [java] 
     [java] Alexei loosed , and the arrow leapt from the bow and embedded itself in the wooden spike which rose from the dome of a house two streets away .
     [java] 
     [java] I hang my clothes in the wardrobe and put on the plastic gown .
     [java] 
     [java] While Therese watched , Leonie hung her few clothes in the wardrobe .
     [java] 
     [java] Later , the process of immersing herself further in a familiar world took a more theoretical turn :
     [java] 
     [java] If you burn or scald yourself , immediately immerse the affected part in cold water for as long as possible , or keep putting a cold , wet pad over it .
     [java] 
     [java] Blanche in turn was happy to immerse herself in country life for a few days and play endless games with her two nephews .
     [java] 
     [java] Quickly he immerses us in the euphoria of the Israelites and the terror and bravado of their enemies .
     [java] 
     [java] He left school at sixteen and immersed himself in the Labour Party , canvassing for the 1966 general election .
     [java] 
     [java] Common sense told her that by immersing herself in work the memory of the last months would recede , and with it would go her bitterness and sense of loss .
     [java] 
     [java] A cuticle cream is then applied and the fingers immersed in a bowl of warm water .
     [java] 
     [java] To implant multi-party democracy in ancient nations like Poland and Hungary makes historical sense .
     [java] 
     [java] This led some to speak of a `` natural religion '' implanted in the human heart and necessary to human well-being .
     [java] 
     [java] Because Dustin had eaten a few hours previously , the anaesthetist had to insert a tube in his mouth to stop him choking on his own vomit .
     [java] 
     [java] No attempt should be made to restrict an employee 's future place of work by inserting a restraint-of-trade clause in the contract of employment .
     [java] 
     [java] Not content with this , a successful male inserts a chemical plug in the female which prevents other males mating with her and causes any male which sniffs it to become impotent for days .
     [java] 
     [java] Another , their influential sweeper Franco Baresi , is to have a metal plate inserted in the left arm he broke in Sunday 's derby win over Internazionale .
     [java] 
     [java] The terms and conditions inserted in this layout will also need to be uniform for each type of bill or related electronic message .
     [java] 
     [java] From the machining room the sails go through to the packaging department where they are folded , inserted in sail bags and sent either to the despatch department or put into stock .
     [java] 
     [java] The constable had five stitches inserted in a wound in his left wrist .
     [java] 
     [java] She laid everything in an untidy heap in the leather box .
     [java] 
     [java] He looked round for the phone , found it and took it to the woman , laying it in her lap .
     [java] 
     [java] So he dug a grave with his sword , laid the poor girl in it , and planted the split reed above her .
     [java] 
     [java] She leaned her head in her hands .
     [java] 
     [java] Young Donald leaned his long-barrelled small-shot gun in the corner by the door and then his face darkened over .
     [java] 
     [java] `` You 'd better help Betty load the stuff in the car . ''
     [java] 
     [java] She watched -- helpless again -- as Mrs Taxos loaded luggage in two panniers on one of the donkeys .
     [java] 
     [java] Mathers lodged the cigarette in his mouth and closed one eye against the smoke .
     [java] 
     [java] The Magistrate had long been interested in Lucy but not because Cupid had at last managed to lodge an arrow in his stony heart .
     [java] 
     [java] His climbing achievements are many , but it is his attempts on Everest which have lodged him firmly in the public consciousness .
     [java] 
     [java] `` After processing I mount the slides in glass to keep them safe , because they are more delicate than conventional slides .
     [java] 
     [java] Over the mottled beige tiled mantel piece , with its brass jar filled with coloured spills , was a glass case of military cap badges mounted in wooden frames .
     [java] 
     [java] Ideally , every trailer should be anchored by the ball hitch on to a ball mounted in the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] He left John Fox , 25 , screaming in pain as his mum and horrified regulars packed his severed ear in ice .
     [java] 
     [java] She packed her mail in the saddlebag .
     [java] 
     [java] Try to park in a well-lit , preferably busy area .
     [java] 
     [java] Earlier that morning , she had piled the bedsheets in a corner of the room ; a sweet aroma of grapes still clung to them .
     [java] 
     [java] When they 'd gone Maggie gathered up the rest of the dishes and piled them in the sink .
     [java] 
     [java] 1 Place the lamb in a dish and sprinkle over half of the rosemary and thyme and one tablespoon of the oil .
     [java] 
     [java] That explains why any attempt to place Minimalist sculptures in the landscape or in urban sites reduces them invariably to homeless objects .
     [java] 
     [java] John took the empty cups down below and placed them quietly in the small sink .
     [java] 
     [java] Cover the dish and place in the refrigerator for at least 5hr , until the fish has turned white and has a cooked appearance .
     [java] 
     [java] The emphasis was to be mainly on placements in inner city areas .
     [java] 
     [java] It has a 22-week programme leading to placement in work or further education , including a four-week overseas project , in Romania or Germany this year .
     [java] 
     [java] When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school .
     [java] 
     [java] Placements in parishes are complemented by one or two three-week residential community placements in which life in a non-church institution , like a hospital , is observed .
     [java] 
     [java] The following summary of ideas on stress placement in nouns , verbs and adjectives is an attempt to present a few rules in the simplest possible form .
     [java] 
     [java] Or had someone planted the idea in Alexander 's mind ?
     [java] 
     [java] She cleared the sills in the greenhouse and planted more seeds in flowerpots , repairing the holes in the glass with sheets of polythene .
     [java] 
     [java] On the UK mainland , two IRA bombers were blown up as they planted a bomb in St Albans , Hertfordshire , on Nov. 15 .
     [java] 
     [java] She folded napkins to look like coronets and gave the crystal glasses a final polish before positioning them in groups to the right of each place .
     [java] 
     [java] Keep positioning yourself in the correct line while turning your own centre-line towards the opponent .
     [java] 
     [java] Remember our earlier advice about positioning the tank in your house ( PFK March ) .
     [java] 
     [java] He rests both thumbs in the waistband of his trousers .
     [java] 
     [java] He baited his baskets and set them in the water , he was so cunning !
     [java] 
     [java] The aim of the symposium is rather to situate Panofsky in history ; that is to say , we are not asking whether his methods are still applicable and relevant .
     [java] 
     [java] The narrator then proceeds to give some background information , which he situates in a previous time About four months before .
     [java] 
     [java] He stood the pencil upright in the centre .
     [java] 
     [java] Islamic Jihad had stashed Waite in the basement car park of a four-storey building in Baalbeck , in the Bekaa Valley .
     [java] 
     [java] He would pull over later and stash the manual in the compartment beneath the battery .
     [java] 
     [java] Think again , Ashley told herself as , having checked that the purchases stashed in the buggy 's basket were secure , she started the return climb up the lane .
     [java] 
     [java] But as he made his getaway , shoppers wrestled him to the ground forcing him to drop the stolen loot -- along with $200 he had stashed in a pocket -- and he fled empty-handed .
     [java] 
     [java] Maura pushed her way through the adults and stationed herself in the front room next to the table piled high with food .
     [java] 
     [java] She folded his discarded jeans and shirt and stowed them in a locker , then turned his sleeping-bag inside out and shook it .
     [java] 
     [java] He stowed the globes in a styrofoam case like an over-sized egg box .
     [java] 
     [java] Most people keep a gun or two in the house ; some carry them around with them , or stow them in the glove compartments of their cars .
     [java] 
     [java] Order a take away and open the bottle you have stowed in your Survival Pack .
     [java] 
     [java] And then Sally Gunnell talked to me about stuffing her gold medal in a cupboard at home .
     [java] 
     [java] `` She told me , thank God , that she had to stuff a handkerchief in her mouth to stop laughing too loudly . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The car and the trucks accelerated into the night , the same night that concealed the sergeant as he stuffed the money in his pocket , telling himself that Rommel knew best .
     [java] 
     [java] James slid off the arm of the sofa and stuffed his hands in his trouser pockets .
     [java] 
     [java] Shamlou picked up the buff envelope and stuffed it in the pocket of his windcheater .
     [java] 
     [java] Jamie is not the type to tuck himself in bed early .
     [java] 
     [java] She did turn from him then , to tuck her shirt in her waistband , and to hide the baffling tears that stung at her eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] Without tucking the shirt in his pants , he pulls a royal red tie over his head that has been pre-knotted , I 'm sure by his wife , Lonnie .
     [java] 
     [java] With one swift motion McGowan reached up , took the glasses off and tucked them in his pocket .
     [java] 
     [java] Take off scarves , too , while your child is playing and tuck in the dangling toggles on anoraks and jackets .
     [java] 
     [java] Jenkins said , deftly taking the coaster from Laidlaw 's hand and discarding it unobtrusively in the bin under the counter .
     [java] 
     [java] She backed in a gentle arc to face the open sea , and as Neil gunned the engine she jumped forward and then settled to a smooth , fast pace .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Masses of shear water burrows in that direction . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Some trilobites lost their eyes , probably those that burrowed in mud or lived in lightless parts of the ocean .
     [java] 
     [java] Whenever Shiva considered the word he saw in his mind 's eye a grinning Mephistopheles with small , curly ram 's horns , capering in frock coat .
     [java] 
     [java] If the beetles crawl in any direction they will get to the edge .
     [java] 
     [java] I yearn for a night beneath a sound roof , without insects crawling in my hair and vermin nibbling my toes . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Marguerite was sleeping and Jenna crept downstairs in the silent house and made her way to the kitchen to fix herself a milky drink .
     [java] 
     [java] If the barracuda presses its attack , then once again the great number of bodies darting in all directions make selecting a target difficult .
     [java] 
     [java] Virtually anything is possible here and , for a relaxing change of pace , it is worthwhile hunting out a slow boat instead of sticking to a frenetic dash in the fast lane .
     [java] 
     [java] Small birds flitted in the shade of the branches and bees were crawling over the red and white clover .
     [java] 
     [java] `` You said something last week about `` gambolling in the countryside '' .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We were hiking in Milcreek Canyon in Utah .
     [java] 
     [java] Police said 26-year-old Amanda Glazier from Wales , who is an experienced skier and keen walker , sprained both ankles after falling down a bank while hiking in the mountains north of Wellington .
     [java] 
     [java] What was going to happen when her little jaunt in France was over , for instance ?
     [java] 
     [java] Two streams come down from a hilly hinterland and after a sedate infancy suddenly leap in a happy frolic through verdant surroundings to reach the village where they converge as the River Greta .
     [java] 
     [java] A wounded horse limped in the wheat , trying to catch up with the other cavalry horses .
     [java] 
     [java] After a great while his footsteps lumbered in their direction .
     [java] 
     [java] He backed away , and still they struck and lunged in his direction ; he backed away even more until he could barely see them in the gloom .
     [java] 
     [java] More than 4,000 officers were on standby after running battles broke out between farmers and police during a protest march in Paris last week .
     [java] 
     [java] Section 5 , enacted to deal with Fascist marches in the East End of London , had become unsatisfactory for several reasons .
     [java] 
     [java] Thousands of workers and students were reported to have staged protest marches in cities throughout Colombia in opposition to the visit of US President George Bush .
     [java] 
     [java] On March 8 , 1,000 Turkish journalists joined a march in Ankara to honour Emec , demanding tougher action against terrorism .
     [java] 
     [java] This is the favoured route of invading armies marching in either direction .
     [java] 
     [java] A M NG town came to a standstill as thousands of pitmen and their supporters marched INI in protest at plans to close a colliery and sack 730 miners .
     [java] 
     [java] January 19 and 26 saw a combined total of 300,000 anti-war activists march in Washington and an equal number take to the streets of San Francisco .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's almost as if he paces in the corner of the office waiting to get his hands on me -- and he gets jealous when I 'm writing about someone else . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Able-bodied youngsters were prowling the streets in droves .
     [java] 
     [java] The monsters were prowling in the bedroom , searching for her .
     [java] 
     [java]  In North America the mighty bison once roamed in tens of millions .
     [java] 
     [java] The Lost Boys romp in what Banning knowingly describes as `` a Lord of the Flies free-school '' , hurling multi-coloured food and gross insults .
     [java] 
     [java] The dog licked Master 's face , and they romped together in the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] A colleague stumbled on the couple romping in a first-floor office just yards from the council chamber .
     [java] 
     [java] Nobody laughed , and Otto assured her in his best smoothie tones that said beast was scampering in the Elysian fields and piddling all over archangels ' sandals .
     [java] 
     [java] His horse put up waterfowl and once disturbed a whole field of rabbits that scampered in panic towards the hedgerows .
     [java] 
     [java] Spurs regained the lead in the 51st minute after a mad scramble in the United area before Jason Dozzell slotted home .
     [java] 
     [java] As he argued it , he had no option but to skulk in alleys .
     [java] 
     [java] A couple of wretches on the run , skulking in the bushes on the lookout for prey , would never have dared break cover and try their luck with us .
     [java] 
     [java] No raincoated figure skulks furtively in the shadowy corners of the Groucho club , hissing `` Martin Amis is in .
     [java] 
     [java] She would not be reduced to skulking in the back room of her own shop .
     [java] 
     [java] Hyaenas , having spent the day skulking aimlessly in the thickets or strolling in a leisurely way across open ground , now become transformed into determined hunters .
     [java] 
     [java] Now , Shelley , tell me what you were reading when you were skulking in the woods today . ''
     [java] 
     [java] When she was feeling down , Old Mother Walsh was always going on about how the snake was slithering in our direction .
     [java] 
     [java] A plump figure in a dress of olive green silk came towards me from the dining room , walking so quickly that she skidded and slithered in her evening slippers on the marble floor .
     [java] 
     [java] Horses slipped and slithered in the mud and mounted men had difficulty in staying in their saddles .
     [java] 
     [java] Camille , who had sneaked in unseen to borrow the garlic-crusher , overheard this exchange and smiled .
     [java] 
     [java] We both got out of the jeep as fast as we could and sprinted in the direction of the slit trenches .
     [java] 
     [java] So the camouflaged couple must sprint in a semblance of skating motion -- to lure another shuriken-starman with urgent gestures , and snuff him .
     [java] 
     [java] She was confident that there was little danger of Anthony staggering in his father 's footsteps .
     [java] 
     [java] Mike Chittenden staggered in flames into a neighbouring office where terrified workers doused the flames .
     [java] 
     [java] `` He staggered in ten minutes ago with a broken tail .
     [java] 
     [java] Scathach 's horse panicked and he shouted at the creature , which stamped in the water , twisting and tugging with discomfort .
     [java] 
     [java] She stepped forward in a manner that was so delicate it was repulsive .
     [java] 
     [java] SOLDIERS step in a stooped position through the narrow steel door placed a foot off the ground in the concrete wall .
     [java] 
     [java] They strode confidently ahead in nice straight parallel lines .
     [java] 
     [java] You could take a stroll in the grounds .
     [java] 
     [java] We took a stroll in the garden where we were joined by Jill .
     [java] 
     [java] With design in Germany racing forward , some of their ideas for coordinating fabrics in the bedroom with colours in your wardrobes can create an image which is as cool as a stroll in the Black Forest .
     [java] 
     [java] The country loving politician was strolling in a 1,500 acre forest near Washington DC , when the light began to fade .
     [java] 
     [java] On the Saturday , before the tourists had emerged from their breakfasts , she strolled in warm winter sunshine towards San Marco , the guide book in her hand closed for once .
     [java] 
     [java] At last a lone figure staggered out , singing raucously as he swaggered in a drunken stupor .
     [java] 
     [java] Leisure Pool -- Enjoy a swim in the relaxed family environment in sparkling clear water without the usual `` swimming pool odours '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Radish certainly does n't fancy a swim in the baboon 's hairy lair but she likes a quick dip in the basin , and she 's getting very good at dives off the window-sill down into the water .
     [java] 
     [java] Stretching to ease tired muscles , she debated whether to go for a swim in the pool or opt for a long soak in a warm scented bath .
     [java] 
     [java] If that was n't enough , the facilities of a swim in the pool , a pitch and putt or a quiet walk in the beautiful surroundings were all available .
     [java] 
     [java] On the shelves there were fish swimming in the air as if it was their natural habitat .
     [java] 
     [java] The fact that Pip 's food was swimming in gravy by the end of the meal is very amusing .
     [java] 
     [java] A second female is shot behind the eye and swims erratically in half-circles before floating motionless on the surface .
     [java] 
     [java] But those incidents involved well piranhas , not those calmly swimming in their home stream .
     [java] 
     [java] They not only surf and swim in it , but paint it , photograph it , worship , contemplate and consult it .
     [java] 
     [java] It felt , as we struggled up the last , steepest stage of the hillside , that we were swimming in the white light of the sun .
     [java] 
     [java] You come home to find your children swimming in the Koi pond .
     [java] 
     [java] The elephants were n't swimming in the pond , they were floating on their backs , and one of them was balancing me gently on the flat tops of its upturned feet .
     [java] 
     [java] The glint from the spear swam in the dark surface of the rock , and , irrelevantly , she noticed her own reflection there -- a vague , just-perceptible shape like a shadow .
     [java] 
     [java] Mao Tse Tung compared guerrillas to fish that swim in the water of a sympathetic population .
     [java] 
     [java] Dawn and evening the three , tall Ruari , gangly Ranald , tiny Luch , tramped in uneven procession up to the moor carrying a dozen bags of leather .
     [java] 
     [java] Dynamic duo Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the Mario brothers tread warily in the sinister city of Dinohatten .
     [java] 
     [java] I would be treading a little widely in the direction of sub judice if I were to answer that , because any decision is for the jurisdiction of the court .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We never willed to do him wrong , '' said the Franciscan of Leicester , treading gratefully in the thick turf with his crippled feet .
     [java] 
     [java] They trekked in single file for more than an hour , holding their rifles high in front of their chests , without sighting any animals at all .
     [java] 
     [java] Two members of the team have trekked widely in the Hispar area and Hillen , Tyson and Lister had six months high-altitude mountaineering experience in the Andes during two successful expeditions in 1989 .
     [java] 
     [java] Last time round they went to south east Asia , trekked in Nepal as far as the Everest base camp , saw Thailand and China then came back on the Trans-Siberian Railway .
     [java] 
     [java] Barth himself later said that he had been like a man who , tripping in the darkness of the church tower , had accidentally caught hold of the bell-rope to steady himself and alarmed the whole countryside .
     [java] 
     [java] They trotted in tandem around the floor , high-stepping to the whim of a muscular young man who held the reins behind them .
     [java] 
     [java] Stamping their hopelessly outsize boots , they trudged in single file out of the gutted , white-stone church and slogged off over a ditch away from the barricade .
     [java] 
     [java] Before I drew level , the door opened and a youth waddled uncomfortably in the general direction of the van .
     [java] 
     [java] The youngest of all have been here all morning , waddling in snow up to their arm-pits .
     [java] 
     [java] We went for walks in the enchanting gardens of Bath .
     [java] 
     [java] I went for a walk in the woods .
     [java] 
     [java] Many wander aimlessly in the shopping centre , or play games machines in the arcades .
     [java] 
     [java] Keeping bent double , Hoomey wriggled in a frenzy back out of the door .
     [java] 
     [java] What they saw , as one put it , were two people who were n't up to boating in the bath , never mind on the Thames in spate .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm off canoeing in the Rockies for a fortnight with Mr Robinson .
     [java] 
     [java] To take the example of chalk , some of the most memorable days of my childhood were spent cycling in the North Downs in Surrey .
     [java] 
     [java] Cycling in the north-eastern tip of France and in Belgium , which the Tour enters on Friday 10 July , has something of the character of the area .
     [java] 
     [java] This means that in order to paddle a straight line in a white water boat we need to include a bit of steering into the forward stroke .
     [java] 
     [java] Rowing a flat-bottomed punt in rough water , against a strong wind , is nigh on impossible on your own , and a back-breaking task even for two .
     [java] 
     [java] We would n't have been able to skate in Britain , so it 's great to be in Milton Keynes .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Clever Miss Prim , '' he murmured , swivelling his enigmatic gaze in her direction .
     [java] 
     [java] Bill now shot a baleful glance in her direction .
     [java] 
     [java] He paused to throw another fierce glance in their direction .
     [java] 
     [java] She half tumbled down the stairs , and Johnny , hearing the sound of her rapid descent , glanced upwards in the direction of the landing .
     [java] 
     [java] The girl flashed one brief look in Hotspur 's direction , and for an instant the glitter of her eyes seemed to him hunted and wild .
     [java] 
     [java] Have a look in your sandwiches .
     [java] 
     [java] '' Most people take notice of me , '' he said , '' but , '' looking pointedly in the direction of Eva , newly returned to work .
     [java] 
     [java] She wrote that note while pretending to look in her handbag .
     [java] 
     [java] I peeked in the bag .
     [java] 
     [java] The Doctor peered in the direction she had indicated .
     [java] 
     [java] By peering hard in the same direction , I could just make out the faint flicker of a distant plane .
     [java] 
     [java] He strolled up the long arcade , pausing frequently to peer in shop windows at the expensive goodies .
     [java] 
     [java] Willie peered in the window and wiped away the mist his breath was making on the glass .
     [java] 
     [java] The person sitting on the low wall did not move , even when Pol cast a meaningful stare in its direction .
     [java] 
     [java] Mary stared in horror .
     [java] 
     [java] Nuadu , aching in every bone , the lower part of his face constrained within the harsh red mask fashioned from the Robemaker 's ropes of light , had not made a sound .
     [java] 
     [java] The next morning Corbett woke , feeling dirty and aching in every joint .
     [java] 
     [java] He ached in odd parts and his cuts stung with the disinfectant Cally had used .
     [java] 
     [java] The muscles ached in his thighs and calves .
     [java] 
     [java] The radiotherapy treatment killed the cervical cancer in mother-of-four Jennifer , but it burned a hole in her bowel .
     [java] 
     [java] Two weeks ago a mother was seriously hurt in a crash while taking her three children to school on the A167 at Ferryhill .
     [java] 
     [java] Now he stood near the door with his hands clasping each other behind his back and his scalp itching furiously in the heat .
     [java] 
     [java] Creams or ointments containing steroids often help reduce the inflammation and itching in the skin but should n't be used for long periods of time .
     [java] 
     [java] We detected a faint diesel odour in the accommodation during our visit .
     [java] 
     [java] He displayed that strange other-worldliness that I have sometimes detected in other people who follow some strict religious code .
     [java] 
     [java] Was that boredom she could detect in his voice ?
     [java] 
     [java] He felt the key in his pocket .
     [java] 
     [java] I could hear his voice in my ear .
     [java] 
     [java] And beyond , a nightmare creature , barely perceived in the swirling dense smoke , beating at the flames coming from its own body .
     [java] 
     [java] Among all these grand people , I see a small woman in a figure-hugging black number with fringes .
     [java] 
     [java] You can see this typical shape in some house plants , such as weeping fig .
     [java] 
     [java] They may be able to see in the dark , sense compass direction , and recognize danger .
     [java] 
     [java] She did not waste time thinking it could be Oliver whose quiet movement she had sensed in the bedroom .
     [java] 
     [java] He pressed hard and hot against her , his lips echoing the hunger she could sense in his body .
     [java] 
     [java] Henry was going to add a chapter towards the end of The Complete History of Wimbledon in which he planned to deal with the failure of nerve he sensed in the place .
     [java] 
     [java] He would clearly hate to be patronized ; he would smell patronage in any apology , in any request for help made out of desire to soothe sore feelings .
     [java] 
     [java] He smelt smoke in her hair , felt her flesh soft under her shawl , and then a further quake in the crowd parted them .
     [java] 
     [java] He smelled the burning in the air , saw the stars dimmed by smoke above him .
     [java] 
     [java] Smelling the fresh dust in the air he realised that the load of grain in the hopper had only recently been discharged into the stall .
     [java] 
     [java] Libby smelt sickness in the brown canvas walls .
     [java] 
     [java] Other countries will smell British self-interest in these directives , and not just because Sir Leon Brittan is the commissioner who dreamed them up .
     [java] 
     [java] He is a navy-brat , son of a captain in the surface fleet .
     [java] 
     [java] A friend of mine , when he was a little boy , was travelling in a train with his father who was a captain in the navy .
     [java] 
     [java] Fraser was Sheriff of Kincardine , and with Keith from Dunottar , marching south , had heard that Balliol had left Perth , appointing the Earl of Fife to command there in his absence .
     [java] 
     [java] The latest and perhaps the final pronouncement on the so-called Walhein direction was made by Lord Lane C.J . presiding in a court of five judges in Reg. v. Watson [ 1988 ] Q.B. 690 .
     [java] 
     [java] The gold letters M O R S encircle the globe , and ultimate judgement is depicted in the heavens above where angels blow the last trumpet and Christ reigns in glory .
     [java] 
     [java] He 's set to reign in Spain
     [java] 
     [java] The emperor Jahangir , who ruled in the fifteenth century , was said to have 12,000 war elephants in his personal army and over 40,000 in his entire kingdom .
     [java] 
     [java] The people are brave , resilient , humorous , friendly in the face of great change and adversity .
     [java] 
     [java] The hon. and learned Gentleman is friendly in his remarks .
     [java] 
     [java] He was then still slightly shy in company , though sharp and confident in other areas and among his equals , like the pool halls where he would hustle for a few dollars .
     [java] 
     [java] Maybe it is they who are being too timid in their ideas and proposals .
     [java] 
     [java] Within the core enterprises and countries control will become less authoritarian in the workplace as new forms of market discipline substitute for the external surveillance of supervision , changes fostered by extensive deregulation .
     [java] 
     [java] Many of these schools are more liberal in tone and educational curriculum , and have higher academic standards and a better environment than township schools .
     [java] 
     [java] The hideous Hollywood hack Hedda Hopper was uncharacteristically liberal in her views .
     [java] 
     [java] We listened to the soundtrack through the back wall of the cinema , separated from each other by plates filmed in olive oil with pools of tomato juice , and half finished wine .
     [java] 
     [java] Real economic growth rates can be used to assess the expansion in a country 's output of goods and services .
     [java] 
     [java] Kielder Water , the largest man-made reservoir in Europe , surrounded by the largest man-made forest in Europe , was opened by HM The Queen in June 1982 , and has been developed into a major water-sports centre .
     [java] 
     [java] C. The photograph shows two of the storage reservoirs in the Pennines .
     [java] 
     [java] Alexandra looked uncomprehending and moved to put her spoon in her soup .
     [java] 
     [java] They do n't come cheap in a place like this .
     [java] 
     [java] The ovaries are the female equivalent of the male testes but are rather more economical in their production of seed , each releasing one egg every other month .
     [java] 
     [java] Thus a lady will smoke , talk slang , or be extravagant in dress ; and will declare her intention of doing as she likes '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Both were frugal in their use of energy and time .
     [java] 
     [java] `` SURE of foot , hard of hide , strong in constitution , frugal in diet , a first-rate weight carrier , indifferent to heat and cold , he combines the best of the most homely characteristics of both the noble houses from which he is descended . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Following his return from exile on April 12 , former President James Mancham , ousted in a coup in 1977 , met with President France-Albert Rene on April 21 .
     [java] 
     [java] The attacks increased in intensity and duration in the reign of Emperor Justinian I ( 527-65 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] OFFICIALS from the Group-of-Seven largest seven market economies will gather in Frankfurt today to put the finishing touches to a plan designed to lead to a $35billion increase in the resources of the International Monetary Fund .
     [java] 
     [java] The apparent reason for this increase in imports was a reduction in demand from China which had a major impact on the international market for urea ( see Lancaster , 1989 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] 1992 saw a substantial increase in both tendering activity and value of work obtained , provided outstanding low bids become firm contracts .
     [java] 
     [java] Whether in the long term this will lead to a permanent increase in output , or whether it will simply lead to higher prices , is again a fiercely debated question .
     [java] 
     [java] The biggest influence on this behaviour has probably been the large increase in wealth , which in turn boils down to the sharp rise in house prices .

     [java] A second line of attack is that the proposed harmonizing measure is inadequate in scope .
     [java] 
     [java] This now appears inadequate in its view of mathematics and of the learner .
     [java] 
     [java] I stayed there for three days , until the snow began to melt , dripping in stealthy drops from my little roof .
     [java] 
     [java] Water flowed in the centre , shallow and sluggish .
     [java] 
     [java] The ancient Chinese believed that the electrical energy of the body flowed in specific channels known as the acupuncture meridians , and charts illustrating these have been known for several thousands of years .

     [java] 
     [java] It is also seen as significant in the Davies camp that Neil Kinnock , the party leader , is remaining neutral in the contest .
     [java] 
     [java] Although he had been nominated for the presidency by Civic Forum ( of which he was a founder member ) and PAV , it was understood that he would remain strictly neutral in the election campaign .
     [java] 
     [java] Must he now grind his pride in the dust and sue for the hand of she to whom he owed that indignity ?
     [java] 
     [java] He picked up the dry droppings and crumbled them in his hand .
     [java] 
     [java] The new organisation rivals DNA in its complexity .

     [java] There a vast palace , rivalling Versailles in scope , had been built , containing one of the most beautiful opera houses in Europe .
     [java] 
     [java] Their numbers soon equalled two divisions in strength .
     [java] 
     [java] They are bright and enchanting and look superb in a rock garden , at the front of a border or in pots .
     [java] 
     [java] The ideas might be splendid in themselves but you must consider how they will contribute to the strategy .
     [java] 
     [java] Even today Auntie Jean was straight-backed and splendid in high heels and a dark-blue dress with a diamond brooch in the shape of a diving fish pinned to her front .
     [java] 
     [java] Townscapes in Watercolour is splendid in every respect .
     [java] 
     [java] We know about the lovely girls who model , they look wonderful in everything , but how about someone like Ma Larkin ?
     [java] 
     [java] The modern car ferry was like a nautical greenhouse with the sun streaming in the south-facing picture windows -- passengers ' heads wilting with heat and motion like so many tomato plants .
     [java] 
     [java] There is no consistent air movement , and the seeds are drifting outwards in all directions from the tree .
     [java] 
     [java] Alternatively the capsule might be drifting in the weak gravitational field of intergalactic space .
     [java] 
     [java] A white yacht carrying navigation lights glided in ghostly silence through the seeming maze of moored craft , putting out to sea .

     [java] 
     [java] Mr Justice Stable told a jury that the words `` to deprave and corrupt '' must not be construed as `` to shock and disgust '' , which is not a criminal offence , the argument Lord Gardiner had deployed in gaining an acquittal in the Lady Chatterley case .
     [java] 
     [java] All four of the white Los Angeles police officers , whose acquittal in the Rodney King beating case sparked several days of rioting in the city in late April and early May [ see p. 38894 ] , were indicted by a grand jury on Aug. 4 on federal charges of violating King 's civil rights .
     [java] 
     [java] An article which appeared in the paper contained comments by three jurors on what occurred when they retired to consider their verdict in one of the most complex trials in British legal history .
     [java] 
     [java] In the same week as the verdicts in the Guinness trial the Department of Trade and Industry published a report into the Lloyds ' insurance market which suggested that big frauds were almost impossible to prevent :
     [java] 
     [java] By the 1880s the mines and foundries , manned by immigrant labour , had begun to outstrip their German rivals in the production of coal and steel .

     [java] 
     [java] Chairman Sam Hammam denied in a programme article that Wimbledon would merge with Crystal Palace or any other club .
     [java] 
     [java] His disclosure in a Commons written reply comes after changes in civil defence policy after the ending of the Cold War .
     [java] 
     [java] Other exceptional items should be disclosed in the notes , except where disclosure in the profit and loss account is necessary to give a true and fair view .
     [java] 
     [java] It is not clear whether the courts would take the same attitude in relation to a general disclosure in a discretionary customer agreement of the fact that the firm might sometimes act as principal .
     [java] 
     [java] I would be obliged to receive a full apology and explanation in the September issue , as these lies and allegations are seriously jeopardising my business activities .
     [java] 
     [java] Again , there is likely to be a mismatch between the function of explanations in the classroom and the function of explanations in everyday conversation .
     [java] 
     [java] Winterthur is Switzerland 's sixth largest town , but none surpasses it in artistic richness .
     [java] 
     [java] Certainly , it surpassed in bulk and cost anything yet seen in Romania and was on a scale approaching Imelda Marcos 's spendthrift acquisitions .
     [java] 
     [java] Ever since its own time this parliament has been known as the `` Good Parliament '' ; it has been thoroughly analysed by modern historians , and the Anonimalle Chronicle of St Mary 's Abbey , York , preserves an account of the deliberations amongst the commons which surpasses in its detail any other surviving account of the debates in a fourteenth-century parliament .
     [java] 
     [java] Hugh Caulfield from the Crabtree department , was dressed up as Santa , looking magnificent in his robes and fine beard .
     [java] 
     [java] He was propped up on one elbow , his dark hair sweat-curled , his eyes gleaming with desire , his naked chest and arms magnificent in their absolute masculinity .
     [java] 
     [java] We 're compatible in other areas ''

     [java] `` I know it 's weird , '' she went on , `` but pleasure is merely the result of naturally occurring chemicals secreted in the brain , and cocaine can turn those chemicals on like a faucet .
     [java] 
     [java] Gregory claims that it was the king who insisted that the consecration should be held at Metz , out of affection for the candidate , but this may be a euphemism for saying that consecration in Clermont was too dangerous .
     [java] 
     [java] Buid describe these feelings in terms of the soul rising up from the chest into the neck and issuing forth in bitter words or even violence if not held in check by the mind .
     [java] 
     [java] A pin dropping in the attic would have shattered the silence .
     [java] 
     [java] The lines are most visible on a clear night , in excess of about 25 metres from a sodium light , and are seen to radiate in planes parallel to the main axis of the lamp fitting .
     [java] 
     [java] Clinging to each other , Melanie laughing , they toppled in slow motion to the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] `` As Julie pulled , Mother toppled sideways in a frightening , wooden sort of way .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Victor , all about us the spores float in the air .
     [java] 
     [java] Dust floated in the beams of light that flooded through the fanlight over the front door .
     [java] 
     [java] Rafts and rafts of water birds floated in the flat sanded estuary .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Popple , upon returning home alone , found the spider floating in the toilet-bowl .
     [java] 
     [java] Nevertheless , she still weighed more than when she had floated in Witwaterstrand .
     [java] 
     [java] Bernice saw creatures flying in the sky about two kilometres away .
     [java] 
     [java] If at any point they lose the scent they fly in zig-zags from side to side until they catch it again , and then fly off upwind again .
     [java] 
     [java] A healthy democracy required change and choice in the character of its government .
     [java] 
     [java] The institutions of health , education and housing powerfully influence our opportunities and choices in later life .
     [java] 
     [java] There is a greater choice in the management of the patient with less urgent bleeding from recurrent varices after sclerotherapy .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We are riding the storm at the moment but things are getting worse in the recession , '' said George .
     [java] 
     [java] But there is no sign of staleness : the performances at the Haymarket are terrific in their strength .

     [java] Sheer fabrics , such as voile or lace , look great in a bathroom setting .
     [java] 
     [java] They 're great in theory . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Royal Bank won its first gold star when it lent $70,000 to help Mr Miller , a professional caterer , to buy a restaurant business in Hampstead , north London .
     [java] 
     [java] When I had a small printing business in Stornoway several of my employees were crofters .
     [java] 
     [java] It was , in fact , one of the first truly fire-proof mills in the country .
     [java] 
     [java] The silk trade blossomed in Blockley due to the sheer number of mills in the locality plus the abundance of pure water .
     [java] 
     [java] This recession is proving especially painful for firms in advertising , retailing , the media and financial services .
     [java] 
     [java] But intense lobbying by asbestos firms in West Germany and Belgium held up agreement .
     [java] 
     [java] In recent years , clothing firms in Western Europe have shrunk in half .
     [java] 
     [java] There they stood beside one another -- two proper boys in their school caps and ill-fitting suits , somewhat comical in the early self-consciousness of those years , but still charming in their vitality .
     [java] 
     [java] He found this young-love rapture almost embarrassing in its intensity ; it was something he was delighted to have , determined to hide , and wary of examining .
     [java] 
     [java] To the untrained observer it was a room , an ordinary room , exciting in no particular way and one which contained the semblance of twelve human occupants .
     [java] 
     [java] The estate seemed small and sad in the rain .
     [java] 
     [java] Instead , Napoleone Lomellini stood there , no longer furred and beringed , in a helm and cuirass dented and dull in the moonlight .
     [java] 
     [java] Those who found politics interesting in the campaign but had not been interested in politics a year earlier gave the press high ratings for helping them decide how to vote .
     [java] 
     [java] He explained that O'Neill 's daughter , who was with her , had observed something interesting in her mother 's stars and she had passed the magazine over to her .
     [java] 
     [java] Asking the way down with the glory of sight restored would have been stupid in the extreme , and I gave secret thanks for my ego salvation .
     [java] 
     [java] There is nothing peculiar or improper in the courts , or anywhere else , proceeding on the assumption that police conclusions are reliable .
     [java] 
     [java] There would have been nothing improper in his paying court to Heather , had she not been his patient .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Beth was wrong in what she did , I wo n't deny that , and I do n't know if I can ever forgive her .
     [java] 
     [java] I shall discuss these effects further in section 2.3 .
     [java] 
     [java] The potash mine is by far the biggest employer in the Whitby and Loftus areas and all local authorities have been considerate in their handling of problems caused by it being on the edge of a national park .
     [java] 
     [java] Cruel in the extreme , she would horsewhip them mercilessly , giving them little food and confining them in cold and filthy cellars .
     [java] 
     [java] Mum had dressed up , and was looking all sweet in a blue dress with a bow at the front .
     [java] 
     [java] Nellie looked sweet in her new frock .
     [java] 
     [java] Norbert Laurens , a DLV anti-doping official , added : `` This is going to make testing difficult in financial and practical terms .
     [java] 
     [java] The problem is particularly difficult in cases of rape and assault where the identification of the suspect by the victim carries great weight .
     [java] 
     [java] It is n't easy in practice to be a good carer . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Paths are undefined up to summit and for much of the descent , but route-finding is quite easy in clear weather .
     [java] 
     [java] Or would she marry some young idiot like this Sebastian and forget all her aspirations in the possession of two children and a semi ?
     [java] 
     [java] The contest for the Democratic nomination was , however , expected to provide significant indications of the party 's aspirations in the final decade of the 20th century .
     [java] 
     [java] Soft facts are also important as they 'll help you to get to know your client better , to understand their feelings , views and aspirations in a number of areas .
     [java] 
     [java] Suddenly a blond boy of about three darted through the door and the precious hope in Kerry 's heart died .
     [java] 
     [java] There was n't a hope in the hospital .
     [java] 
     [java] '' There is mounting hope in the world for better relations , and I think the Soviet Union and Cuba understand their responsibilities .
     [java] 
     [java] Merseyside 's pubs are the best value and friendliest in Britain and that 's official .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr T said the police were perfectly civil in their questioning .
     [java] 
     [java] The fact was that for many years she and her father had been living with a dangerous illusion ; and the illusion was that they were entirely virtuous in their endeavours , entirely on the angels ' side .
     [java] 
     [java] Was that a note of desperation in Piper 's voice ?
     [java] 
     [java] '' No thanks , '' he said , though with a note of envy in his voice .
     [java] 
     [java] The envy in his voice was almost pathetic .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a tinge of envy in his tone , for his humdrum childhood home in Croydon had not provided him with the kind of `` things '' his taste now craved .
     [java] 
     [java] She had seen the pity in her mother 's eyes and a great rage against Janine had rushed through Maura .
     [java] 
     [java] He was nearly fifty and Kate could see the pity in his eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] She could n't bear that , could n't stand to see pity in those dark compelling eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] She had sensed something more than mere adoration in the way he had kissed her and been aware of her body 's response .
     [java] 
     [java] Joanna had looked up at him , open adoration in her glowing sapphire eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] Whether an equivalent car would be made available to a company secretary who was not a family member is a question of fact -- perhaps depending on the size of the company and customs in the particular trade .
     [java] 
     [java] It is not the custom in English cities to name streets by numbers but it has happened .
     [java] 
     [java] The Commission would like to suggest the revival of the custom in some churches of an occasional short voluntary during the service .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's a time-honoured custom in our industry , the easy-going atmosphere you try to create while auditioning young women for roles of an erotic nature .
     [java] 
     [java] A sub-Minoan tradition in painted pottery lingers long , and is replaced by a very individual form of Protogeometric , the later stages of which show , surprisingly , powerful influence from the East .
     [java] 
     [java] It has attempted to weave the mythology of historical liberation struggles with the martyrdom of its own guerrilla fighters of the 1960s and 1970s to create an unbroken thread of radical revolutionary tradition in Latin America .
     [java] 
     [java] Eating habits in the West have changed dramatically during the last ten to twenty years .
     [java] 
     [java] All such activities demand thorough pre-planning and a type of organization not customary in many schools .
     [java] 
     [java] There were no questions or interjections from the floor of the Chamber , as is customary in the British House of Commons , and as had been common debating practice during the Second Republic .
     [java] 
     [java] She saw the quick remorse in Rose 's face and stretched out a hand to her .
     [java] 
     [java] You 'll have to soften it in milk .
     [java] 
     [java] The samples ranged from modern lacquer hardened in the laboratory to objects from the last centuries BC .
     [java] 
     [java] Senna hurt a hand in his mishap but said : `` I am only aware of it when there is a kick-back from the wheel , like on a kerb for example .
     [java] 
     [java] One player definitely missing this weekend is Llanelli and Wales B scrum-half and captain Rupert Moon , who injured his collarbone in the East Wales v West Wales match in Cardiff on Monday .
     [java] 
     [java] We smoke a joint in my car .
     [java] 
     [java] He smoked it deliberately in slow puffs , giving Peter time to consider their situation .
     [java] 
     [java] An investigation at Dean Close School in Cheltenham revealed that seven A level pupils had smoked cannabis in woodland near the school in the last week of term .
     [java] 
     [java] I do n't want to smoke in the office .
     [java] 
     [java] When first grown , the top of the fungus is coated in a black sticky jelly containing spores .
     [java] 
     [java] The chippings are coated in fine snow , and the cold blusters into the carriage through the draught gap .
     [java] 
     [java] Make sure the truffles are completely coated in chocolate .
     [java] 
     [java] Anna Charsky awoke in the bedroom of her pleasant flat overlooking an historic river .
     [java] 
     [java] I awoke in the soundproofed luxury of the Princess Grace Hospital , none the worse for the two-hour operation .
     [java] 
     [java] I awoke in the middle of the night with a pain in the back of my neck and a beating headache .
     [java] 
     [java] He awoke in hazy sunshine , his head clear , the room freezing in the light of a fresh morning .
     [java] 
     [java] He woke in the small hours , feeling cold , and moved over to be closer to Carolyn 's warm body .
     [java] 
     [java] I woke in the morning feeling weak and shaky , but quite normal .
     [java] 
     [java] From the depths of my patchy education , I recalled that Shelley had drowned in a storm on a lake .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's like the time when I nearly drowned in the Mediterranean with you . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The 50-year-old child killer suffered a black eye , bruises and minor cuts as she sat down for a meal at Cookham Wood jail in Kent .
     [java] 
     [java] Three British hostages are on their way home from Iraq , after being freed from a jail in Baghdad .
     [java] 
     [java] Officers have been guarding inmates who can not be accommodated in overcrowded jails following the riots at Strangeways jail in Manchester .
     [java] 
     [java] The lobby was tiled in blue and gave access to a stairway leading to a mezzanine built in U-formation around Studio `` A '' .
     [java] 
     [java] This one and the next , Chalk Farm , were tiled in white and buff , reminding her of the servants ' bathrooms at Temple Stephen .
     [java] 
     [java] Some joined the insurgence and armoured vehicles left the scene of the protest draped in white flags .
     [java] 
     [java] The cavalryman , who was called Lord John Rossendale , was staring at the sumptuous decorations in the supper room where the long tables were draped in white linen and thickly set with silver and fine china .
     [java] 
     [java] There were innumerable bedrooms , some with four-posters , the furniture draped in sheets , two doors leading to separate wings so long disused that the dust lay thick on the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] The kitchen , quarry-tiled , looked out onto a courtyard paved in red brick with various evergreen shrubs in tubs .
     [java] 
     [java] A tray , divided into small partitions , lined in blue velvet , lay empty .
     [java] 
     [java] If that 's what you call walls lined in silk .
     [java] 
     [java] Minutes later 43-year-old Pauline Rees , who works at Trees Park Village at Middleton St George , was shot in the face in her driveway in Lyonette Road .
     [java] 
     [java] I am shown into a huge L-shaped apartment , where the walls , panelled in light , polished wood , are adorned with fine paintings .
     [java] 
     [java] The room , which overlooked the booking hall or the station , was large enough for their purposes and grandly panelled in mahogany .
     [java] 
     [java] The top half of the front door was panelled in opaque glass with a border of little squares of coloured glass running along the top and the two sides .
     [java] 
     [java] Between the windows the drum is richly panelled in carved marble slabs ( 181 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] A 20-year-old man from Wardley is seriously ill in Newcastle General Hospital after being hit by a car on the Felling bypass in Gateshead .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a weariness in the Old Man 's voice , an emptiness inside where once excitement and intrigue had burned .
     [java] 
     [java] A chap in Belgium explained it all to me .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Let the clever pathology chaps in their laboratory decide that , '' said Dr McIntyre .
     [java] 
     [java] `` God , I 've got another letter from that kid in Stretford .
     [java] 
     [java] There `` a kid in a white leather blazer '' had asked her `` Dorothy , do you have some problem at home ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Though conceived for Third World kids the video has also been used with inner-city kids in Washington and New York and with Canadian Indian children .
     [java] 
     [java] There was anger in Jacob 's voice and stance as he led her towards Sylvie 's bedroom .
     [java] 
     [java] There was real anguish in his eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] At last he turned to her and he could not have failed to see the anguish in her eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] She saw the agony in him .
     [java] 
     [java] There was widespread disquiet in the media and elsewhere .
     [java] 
     [java] The anger and astonishment in her face gave way to something very like pity .
     [java] 
     [java] '' No , '' I said , trying to sound convincing but daunted by the simple bewilderment in his face .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Carpenter ? '' her father asked with a tinge of bewilderment in his voice .
     [java] 
     [java] She did n't want to trouble the penguin with the bewilderment in her eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] Equally inevitably , there was outrage and dismay in India .
     [java] 
     [java] Jenna had never heard her own name said with so much accusation and all she could do was nod her head , words sticking in her throat at the blast of displeasure in the dark voice .
     [java] 
     [java] Psalm 13 put her own question well --'How long shall l take counsel in my soul , having sorrow in my heart daily ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] There was genuine sorrow in the producer 's voice .
     [java] 
     [java] Her meagre shilling donation was an embarrassment in this wealthy company , but she refused to think of it .
     [java] 
     [java] I could tell from the blank embarrassment in Tom 's expression that she had not acknowledged him .
     [java] 
     [java] `` This is my wife , May , '' Otley replied with a hint of disappointment in his voice .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a trace of exasperation in his voice as he said : `` I 've told my promoter Dan Duva that I want to fight all those contenders that the people want me to fight .
     [java] 
     [java] Plummer wanted to know , a note of exasperation in his voice .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Can I help you ? '' she asked , trying not to let him see the amusement in her blue eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] There was amusement in Jake 's voice , but there was something else as well .
     [java] 
     [java] But I remember the excitement in my children 's faces .
     [java] 
     [java] When he came to the part about the clip he glanced up , and she saw the flare of excitement in his silvery-green eyes before they dropped once again to the page .
     [java] 
     [java] Cranston repeated , fighting hard to control the excitement in his voice .
     [java] 
     [java] With horror in her eyes , the nurse stated that the young girl had tearfully told the physician the events that had led to her tragic situation .

     [java] 
     [java] The close relationship between the British and American Services , while admirable in most respects , has its dangers .
     [java] 
     [java] Mining communities have always proved admirable in that way .
     [java] 
     [java] With the honourable exception of L'Equipe , who condemned the incident in no uncertain terms on its front page , the French press had an ambiguous , if not sympathetic , reaction .
     [java] 
     [java] Churchill , a strong Zionist supporter , had fiercely condemned MacDonald in the Commons in 1938 and continued his verbal assault afterwards in the Division Lobby of the House of Commons .

     [java] 
     [java] He suddenly realised that it was Diana who had denounced him in the anonymous phone call .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Far worse are those who denounce evil ways in the language of a Hercules ; and after discoursing on virtue , prepare to practise vice . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Communist Party leader Marchais denounced the students in these words , `` The pseudo-revolutionaries of Nanterre and anywhere else labour in vain , they will change nothing of historical reality '' ( quoted Posner , 1970 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Reacting against the enthusiasm with which so many people , including Whig friends and colleagues like Charles James Fox , greeted the outbreak of the French Revolution , Burke denounced democracy in vehement terms .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Asquith continued by denouncing in serious terms the action of the Press .
     [java] 
     [java] `` This time ? '' she exclaimed with a telling note of derision in her voice .
     [java] 
     [java] In stressing this , Engels was clearly strongly influenced not only by Morgan by also by Bachofen whom he praised in this preface to the book .
     [java] 
     [java] The more you can relate your quotations to your audience and the people you are praising in your speech , the more interested and flattered they will feel .

     [java] The Court of Appeal was scathing in its condemnation of this sequence of events .
     [java] 
     [java] He quickly located his man in the deep doorway where he had positioned himself , by the intermittent glow of his cigarette .
     [java] 
     [java] The hopeful view is that the thwarted coup will strengthen Guatemala 's eight-year experiment with democracy and serve as a lesson for other would-be dictators in Latin America .
     [java] 
     [java] It is now generally appreciated that Warner Bros had been particularly badly hit by the depression , largely because of the furious rate at which they had acquired movie-houses in the 1920s .
     [java] 
     [java] A really great scholar , he had a unique opportunity to develop his abilities , because Biscop had brought back to Jarrow some 200 to 300 antique books that he had managed to acquire in southern Italy .
     [java] 
     [java] Should the defendant 's motive be so crucial in cases where the act is not obviously indecent , in the sense that `` right-minded persons '' would not unhesitatingly classify it as such ?
     [java] 
     [java] His study on psychoanalysis was crucial in this respect and it still provides the basic model for the particular notion of social representation ( Moscovici , 1976 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] All equipment manufactured in plastic for use in the aquarium should be non-toxic .

     [java] 
     [java] For example , an Haft Bolah Belouch is a Belouch rug made by the Haft Bolah sub-tribe ; a Ravar Kerman is a Kerman rug made in the nearby village of Ravar .
     [java] 
     [java] Be-1 , Pao and S-Cargo , made in small volumes and sold in Japan at premiums over the Micra model on which they are based , may not be to everyone 's taste .
     [java] 
     [java] Thus book is an attempt to look at some of the things that go on when people face a loss of someone or something significant in their lives .
     [java] 
     [java] It is difficult now to imagine this square without the powerful bronze of Jan Hus gazing upon his church with his followers holding the chalice which was so significant in his religious arguments ( see p. 6 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Amid the ruins on the most remote Highland croft still remains ample evidence of age-old customs and beliefs concerning plants and their significance in the daily lives of the people who lived there .
     [java] 
     [java] Some commentators take a different view , seeing a broader significance in the shift from natural justice to fairness .
     [java] 
     [java] It now remains to ask whether there is any significance in this hitherto unknown fact .
     [java] 
     [java] The Cotswolds were at the forefront of woollen manufacturing in England until the rise of factory industry gave precedence to Yorkshire .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The Star reports the accusation by a Tory MP that the corporation has wasted money by filming a show in Australia ( it needed guaranteed sunshine , says the BBC ) .
     [java] 
     [java] We had a lovely time filming it in Yorkshire .
     [java] 
     [java] Caine was filming in London with Sidney Poitier , and once or twice a week they would take it in turns to treat each other to a decent meal .
     [java] 
     [java] Filming in the Soviet Union is full of uncertainties .
     [java] 
     [java] `` That 's just what I said to myself when I woke up this morning , but when I looked on the floor , there was the veil , torn in two halves ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] This bridge , demolished in January 1956 , had been 30ft high , but was still only level with the towering heaps .

     [java] The authors would welcome comments -- critical or otherwise -- from colleagues and collaborators in the task of generating enthusiasm and understanding of mathematics .
     [java] 
     [java] We had a very happy collaboration in Berlin over Mozart 's Die Zauberflute , which he had been wanting to do for a number of years .
     [java] 
     [java] Current collaboration in the development of staff training materials may augur well for further co-operation and joint training opportunities .
     [java] 
     [java] This study examines the public service broadcasters ' collaboration in the Eurikon and EUROPA satellite television channels , the reasons for the creation of the channels and the reasons for their demise .
     [java] 
     [java] By 1980 the Soviet Union was left with only two substantial associates in the region , Syria and the PLO , themselves uneasy allies against Israel .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Cronkite 's associates in the network saw what others had failed to notice -- Mr Trout was actually an unemployed actor and former colleague named Buck Henry .
     [java] 
     [java] If the NBC Symphony 's virtuosity is already breathtaking in the first and second movements , then the finale is still more amazing in its precision , weight and attack .
     [java] 
     [java] One of these schemes is an agro-industrial project , ambitious by any standards and quite amazing in a poor country ground down by war and economic blockade .
     [java] 
     [java] ENGINEERING experts are confident they can replace vital bolts in Teesside 's famous Transporter Bridge .
     [java] 
     [java] Basically it was about certain British officials allegedly colluding in drug-test avoidance at some meetings in the early eighties .
     [java] 
     [java] And seventeen employers were also prosecuted for colluding in the offences .
     [java] 
     [java] Was she colluding in his tax evading ?
     [java] 
     [java] She clutches her can of Coke and pinpoints her collusion in what her insides scream is her kidnapping .
     [java] 
     [java] In practice , therefore , the size of the money multiplier will vary and is thus difficult to predict in advance .
     [java] 
     [java] Or she might drown him in the bath or push him under a train .
     [java] 
     [java] She let him drown her in the deep water , too weak even to raise her hands to cling to him .
     [java] 
     [java] She asked no questions in return , however , and when Dauntless volunteered information about himself , appeared bored in the extreme .
     [java] 
     [java] Do you have a delight in animals and skill in their management ?
     [java] 
     [java] Trying to hide her enormous delight in his return , Juliet turned to David .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Estelle 's delight in Thomas made your mother very happy , '' Ashley recalled , her head resting against his chest .
     [java] 
     [java] As he stared at the torment , fury , and despair in her face , he knew that Clare would not forgive him .
     [java] 
     [java] For the present situation is due not only to the Magoo-like myopia of Washington and its incompetence in the affairs of any part of the globe not actually State-side , startling though these are .
     [java] 
     [java] Most of their readers are young , white and male and their interest in the music scene is intense .
     [java] 
     [java] BZW think the figures will be largely academic , but there will be plenty of interest in the prospects for the anti-Aids drug Retrovir .
     [java] 
     [java] I think he hoped I might eventually add distinction to the family name , of which he was intensely proud , and his initial interest in me also developed into affection .
     [java] 
     [java] The reason why we arrange trade missions such as the one that I led to Kuwait -- six similar missions have been conducted -- is our interest in stimulating orders for the new Welsh economy .
     [java] 
     [java] Recent years have seen an increased public concern and interest in issues of defence , disarmament and peace .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Budgen was generous in his admiration for Mr Powell -- `` You are the great don of parliamentary debate '' -- but not in much else .
     [java] 
     [java] To date parishioners have been extremely generous in their giving and the scheme has proved a great success .
     [java] 
     [java] This time Osborn was much more generous in his comments to Mumford : `` a far better statement of the problem than the LCC Plan
     [java] 
     [java] Nor was the Soviet Union at this stage inclined to be particularly generous in its terms .
     [java] 
     [java] The UAs covered extra-judicial executions ( EJEs ) , death threats , torture and `` disappearances '' in Colombia , Peru , Brazil , India and the Philippines ; attacks on street-children in Guatemala ; and amputation sentences and crucifixion in Sudan .
     [java] 
     [java] The only real fault is the looseness of the structure : in higgledy-piggledy fashion and at breathless speed , we move from female infanticide in Tamil Nadu to disabled babies in Nairobi .
     [java] 
     [java] John Ngu Foncha , a former Vice-President , had on June 8 resigned as vice-president of the RDPC , protesting among other things at the shooting in May of six people at a pro-democracy demonstration in Bamenda .

     [java] 
     [java] After the recent blood-bath in Westminster Abbey his heart flipped over and his head swam about .
     [java] 
     [java] Even so , the sharp contraction in Poland 's output -- despite the fall in the zloty -- raises doubts about the efficacy of devaluation .
     [java] 
     [java] On current performance , any contraction in local authority building programmes disproportionately disadvantages disabled people .
     [java] 
     [java] The balloon rotated gently in the evening breeze , presenting its serial number to him .
     [java] 
     [java] The thunder thumped from some nearer point , the glass vibrated in the window , and Cameron came out of his doze to find Menzies grinning quizzically at him and offering him some more claret .
     [java] 
     [java] Later we assembled in a large room with the other recruits who had arrived from Cherbourg , Amiens and Rouen .
     [java] 
     [java] `` How ? '' she asked , disappointed that he was n't confiding in her .

     [java] 
     [java] High Mages are wonderful in defence and against daemons .
     [java] 
     [java] At 14 , Gedge was outstanding in several subjects , especially French , and for a while harboured dreams of travelling the world as an interpreter .
     [java] 
     [java] The sea-air clearly suited Alan Judge who was outstanding in goal .
     [java] 
     [java] Murty Killilea and Padraig Kelly were outstanding in defence , with Joe McGrath proving his worth in attack .
     [java] 
     [java] Managers , technicians , and other `` lower professionals '' expanded in number with especial rapidity .
     [java] 
     [java] Vagabonds huddle in the gaps between empty buildings , the fine stucco boasted by their Dutch merchant builders lying like pebbles on the pavements .
     [java] 
     [java] Together , the three hunched in the safe zone .
     [java] 
     [java] The whole business seemed to have shrunk in importance to the size of a peanut anyway .
     [java] 
     [java] Climate and geology had combined in this part of the Oriental Region to produce ideal conditions for the creation of new species and subspecies .
     [java] 
     [java] This merged in 1927 with fellow East End brewers Taylor Walker of Limehouse .
     [java] 
     [java] The columns were to merge in the Hammersmith Road at 6.30 , an hour and a half before the rally .
     [java] 
     [java] Sometimes it poured down in such thick sheets of water that earth and sky seemed merged in one grey wetness
     [java] 
     [java] When the two types unite in a new amalgamated cell the genes are once again in two sets but in new combinations with genes from not just one parent but two .
     [java] 
     [java] She frowned in concentration but at the same time she suddenly looked very tired , as though she should stop and sit down .
     [java] 
     [java] Anneliese was frowning in concern , studying her face then casting a quick , accusing glance at her elder brother .
     [java] 
     [java] As he turned and handed the binoculars to his elder brother he frowned in what he hoped was a manly , intent manner and tried to make his voice sound casual .
     [java] 
     [java] Miss Labrooy frowned in puzzlement .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Rachel and her parents might , '' Maria retorted , and he grimaced in rueful acknowledgement .
     [java] 
     [java] Apparently not only had I collapsed on stage last night , but I was having intravenous chemotherapy between shows , sobbing and grimacing in agony in my dressing room .
     [java] 
     [java] He grimaced in exasperation .
     [java] 
     [java] The creature writhed and grimaced in the most horrible manner , malignance imprinted in its every contour .
     [java] 
     [java] Dunbar was grinning in high content as he wheeled his horse to trot back to his own division .
     [java] 
     [java] Polly grinned in delight , revelling in a heart-swelling sense of power .
     [java] 
     [java] He grinned in a more cheerful manner , then left the office .
     [java] 
     [java] He grins in recollection and there 's mischief in his eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] Nutty sat on the edge with her legs in the water , scowling in deep concentration after Nails .
     [java] 
     [java] She scowled in disgust at the sight of her drooping mouth and reddened eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] It would leave Britain `` scowling in frustration '' on the sidelines of the Community .
     [java] 
     [java] Tamar 's eyes met George 's and they smiled in mutual affection .
     [java] 
     [java] Forrest smiled in approval .
     [java] 
     [java] I smiled in assent .
     [java] 
     [java] When he sees us , he smiles in recognition .
     [java] 
     [java] He smiled in a benevolent sort of way when he said this .
     [java] 
     [java] Dr Ali smirked in triumph .
     [java] 
     [java] Eleven of the 15 babies born in Rinyaszentkiraly in south-west Hungary in 1989-90 had severe abnormalities ; four of them had Down 's syndrome .
     [java] 
     [java] The Law Society has characterised the profession in a number of official statements .
     [java] 
     [java] Rather than describe the required knowledge in general terms , we propose to discuss a number of topics which would embody that knowledge and its relationship to foreign language teaching .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It is a disgrace that the schools minister should describe schools in that way . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I wish to return to those qualities and define them in a more personal way , and with the help of a fine Middle English word : clanness , or `` cleanness '' .
     [java] 
     [java] What matters is that , regardless of their manufacturers , the devices themselves are enemies of each other in the special sense I have defined in this chapter .
     [java] 
     [java] Taken alone the Pacific Ocean can be , like any other , defined in a variety of ways , depending on whether the observer is a geographer , geologist , cartographer , military strategist or fashionably up-to-date economist .
     [java] 
     [java] Analogies and metaphors : these redefine the problem in an imaginative , non-literal fashion .
     [java] 
     [java] This sort of language already sounds ludicrously dated , even though a fair number of East Germans may still seek to redefine their society in different terms from the capitalist West .
     [java] 
     [java] Neither my wins in the European Championships and European Cup nor my two British records had ever made the front page -- but the fact that I would n't run in a relay team had .
     [java] 
     [java] This is the game this is the goal the Swindon fans will treasure for ever their first win in the Premiership it 's taken three months and sixteen games to get it
     [java] 
     [java] Nevertheless , it was the economic climate , as much as the renewed trade union and working-class support for Labour , which contributed significantly to Labour 's victory in the 1929 General Election .
     [java] 
     [java] Further uprisings occurred until 1649 when Oliver Cromwell , fresh from his victory in the English Civil War , brutally put down the recalcitrant Gaels .
     [java] 
     [java] Mike Fibbins , who like Ruckwood was unable to produce his best at the Barcelona Olympics , also bounced back with victory in the 50 metres freestyle .
     [java] 
     [java] With no victor in this game , Tetley are putting the $2,000 allotted to the winning side back into the prize `` kitty '' for the season .

     [java] 
     [java] The most basic instruction is the move , which copies characters from a source field to a destination , until a character with the word mark bit set is encountered in one of the two fields .
     [java] 
     [java] Similarly , choice of the appropriate parts to bolt together must be made if a child is copying a model from the drawings usually supplied with a kit ( involving size , shape and matching ) .
     [java] 
     [java] The Nethercott workshop built a fine specimen of an oak dogleg chimney staircase , with hanging finials and pierced cutout balusters copied from the one baluster of the 17th-century staircase that remained .

     [java] Ashley was glaring at me over the candle flame the way a hawk must glare at a field mouse the instant before it parts mouse from field forever .
     [java] 
     [java] However , segregating income from capital is not only concerned with producing an income figure which might be used as a measure of performance .
     [java] 
     [java] Kossoff prefers to segregate his drawings from his paintings in his exhibitions .
     [java] 
     [java] In addition , these user histories point to the fact that the receptionists of some surgeries were instructed to turn away `` addicts '' or , at least , segregate them from the rest of the patients .
     [java] 
     [java] This approach may be supplemented by segregating young pigs from those of more than nine months of age which will be excreting eggs .
     [java] 
     [java] Individuals should be restricted and segregated from the general community as little as possible .
     [java] 
     [java] By necessity and by choice the Jews were a race apart , the only group entirely segregated from the rest of the community .
     [java] 
     [java] When listening to Ghorbanifar , as a CIA man reported in December 1985 , it was `` extremely difficult to separate the good from the bad information . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Some conclusions are apparent , however , that help to show why buy-outs take place and what separates the wheat from the chaff :
     [java] 
     [java] Who would separate the clean from the unclean ?
     [java] 
     [java] Behind them the wind split a bough from a tree with a sharp crack .
     [java] 
     [java] It was only three years ago that we split our business from Healthcare and we really are a stand-alone Division now , particularly with the advent of M.S.I.L. [ Medical Services Incineration Limited ] .
     [java] 
     [java] Some of the contracts have been straight business deals whereby the Provisionals and the property owners split the profit from the government compensation .

     [java] Luke lifted his lips from her hand briefly , giving her a hard smile .
     [java] 
     [java] Any farm workers who came near the site in the course of their daily work were too busy to lift their eyes from the soil to take in the surrounding landscape , or individual figures moving within it .
     [java] 
     [java] As it does so , it swings its body slightly from side to side , like a machine-gunner raking the enemy ranks .

     [java] She swung herself lightly from the jeep and walked slowly alongside the pool .
     [java] 
     [java] Sladen was looking from George to Husband and back again , twitching his head from side to side like a tennis umpire .

     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Maxham was the first to appear ; Celia recognized him from his previous visits to the office .

     [java] At the time we were rushing from job to job repairing storm damage , and fortunately were both wearing rubber soled boots .
     [java] 
     [java] The waves that rush hither from Kahiki ,
     [java] 
     [java] As the air rushed from her lungs , so his spunk flooded her innards .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Crangle was rushing from place to place checking the details of his plan .
     [java] 
     [java] One of the men now rushed from the room and along a passage to some stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] He travels light , sauntering from aeroplane to passport control with his hands in his pockets and , seemingly , without a care in the world , while others struggle with bags , briefcases and duty-free , looking hot and bothered .
     [java] 
     [java] She sauntered from the room , paused at the door , and turned .
     [java] 
     [java] As the old woman pushed the hand-cart across the yard a number of children scampered from various heaps to gather around her , gabbling .
     [java] 
     [java] He leapt out of bed , grabbed his bathrobe and scampered from the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Watching as the twins scampered from the room , Laura was surprised to find Ross 's arm sliding about her waist .
     [java] 
     [java] He scurried from the hotel .
     [java] 
     [java] Out of the corner of her eye , she caught a movement in the back yard , so she scurried from the room , remembering that Pol was settling the pony .
     [java] 
     [java] Clare continued to stare until the girl scuttled from the bedroom to the patio ; there , she hesitated , remembering her nakedness .
     [java] 
     [java] The yellow-jacketed policeman shuffled uneasily from foot to foot , uncertain of what they should be doing now .
     [java] 
     [java] Emmie shuffled from one foot to the other .
     [java] 
     [java] Ludo and I shuffle from pub to pub , table to table , like the Salvation Army rattling tins .
     [java] 
     [java] All thought skipped from her mind .
     [java] 
     [java] The small dog was sniffing round Contralto 's heels , causing the horse to skip nervously from side to side .
     [java] 
     [java] In the past couple of decades , Britain has managed to slither from one high technology debacle to another .
     [java] 
     [java] Oxford , as unfamiliar with failure as Cambridge are to success , left it to president Pinsent to face the instant inquests following the four and a half mile slog from Putney to Mortlake .
     [java] 
     [java] After the quick sprint from Penumbra' s , the cut there was bleeding heavily .
     [java] 
     [java] Not for the first time , Kevin Blackwell chose to sprint rashly from his goal ; both he and Dixon were beaten by the bounce , and Kevin Wilson outstripped his marker to score .
     [java] 
     [java] A MAN who staggered from a wrecked block of flats in blazing clothes was being operated on in hospital last night .
     [java] 
     [java] He shouted to his wife that he had been stabbed and when the woman walked off he staggered from the car and collapsed .
     [java] 
     [java] Within the last fortnight , the Duchess of York has staggered from one tabloid headline to another .
     [java] 
     [java] Scores of employees who had been inside the building and nearby structures staggered from shattered shops and buildings , some of them weeping .
     [java] 
     [java] Behind him , as he staggered from view , Jimmy saw Barbara standing with the neck of a broken whisky bottle in her hand , seized from one of the Christmas party tables .
     [java] 
     [java] She stamped from the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Then she gathered up her scattered clothing and stole from the room .
     [java] 
     [java] The whole thorny question of Equity membership is linked with the step from drama school to agent 's office -- and indeed applies equally at the audition for the first job .
     [java] 
     [java] She backed two steps from him , then turned and ran towards the building .
     [java] 
     [java] Pesce d'Oro -- just steps from the sea
     [java] 
     [java] Set amongst towering palms , this is a delightful complex of 25 thatched bungalows , simply furnished , but clean and spacious , and just a few steps from the beach .
     [java] 
     [java] He was now only a step from the edge of the platform .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The world we live in , you see , is only a step from the jungle .
     [java] 
     [java] He stepped from the frail craft of gossamer thin nylon and fibreglass .
     [java] 
     [java] Viewed from an overhead perspective , Rufus can stomp from block to block with impunity but falls to his death if he makes a wrong move .
     [java] 
     [java] Pinza strides home from Aureole .
     [java] 
     [java] Then she turned on her heel and strode stiffly from the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Therese strolled from the back door over to the stove where the fish-kettle still stood , awash with cooking juice .
     [java] 
     [java] At night , after dinner , it is very pleasant to stroll from hotel to hotel or to the many bars and small restaurants or , later , to the discotheques .
     [java] 
     [java] As Mark strolled from the hotel and crossed the road to the riverside walk , he had a strange feeling that the evening ahead would re-shape his future .
     [java] 
     [java] The platoon fell in under the eye of CSM Price , who strutted from one edge of the ragged square to the other before taking instructions from Captain Gray .
     [java] 
     [java] Magpies strut from flowerbed to flowerbed , greedily devouring the grubs that he turned up in yesterday 's gardening .
     [java] 
     [java] Jacob grabbed his basket and stumbled blindly from the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Elizabeth 's older brother , Richard , 34 , had come from Somerset to see the place where his `` little sister '' died -- and to join in a defiant swim from the murder beach .
     [java] 
     [java] Presumably they acquire this knowledge when the tide is high and they can swim from one basin to another , and they are able to translate that information into a mental picture of their entire territory .
     [java] 
     [java] To get this far they had to swim from their breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico .
     [java] 
     [java] A water vole swam vigorously across from a little island , its round face and bright eyes showing above the water .
     [java] 
     [java] A grass snake swimming obligingly from island to bank in full view of watchers .
     [java] 
     [java] Does it measure the distance it has swum from the start-point , for instance , or does it orient by use of the environmental cues given by the objects visible on the walls surrounding the tank ?
     [java] 
     [java] Eventually he saw police cars cruising back and forth past the ruined tenement , policemen tramping from house to house .
     [java] 
     [java] The reply tripped smoothly from her lips .
     [java] 
     [java] He had tried to begin the research several times but on each occasion found his mind tripping from thought to thought .
     [java] 
     [java] Dean Fosbury trotted from side to side to take kicks from alternate flags , eventually finding reward when Mickey Street was able to force the ball home .
     [java] 
     [java] After that he and Paul trudged from office to office , going through the motions , expecting nothing .
     [java] 
     [java] It covers an area of some 150 acres and is very shallow ; indeed , prior to mass-afforestation , it was possible to wade from one side to the other , without danger , because the water was so clear .
     [java] 
     [java] The walk from Thun to Heiligenschwendi should require about 1 hour 40 minutes .
     [java] 
     [java] He , after all , found her quite as repulsive as she found him and , as the two of them waltzed from oven to sink , from window to cutlery drawer , staring up , down , sideways , anywhere but at each other , Henry had always assumed that this was no more than the usual politesse of a failed English , suburban marriage .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Every day , I 'd cycle from Clapton to King 's Cross , take the train to Pinewood , then the bus to the studio to be directed by David Lean in scenes with Alec Guinness .

     [java] 
     [java] The huge lock Mesake Rasari , one of the fastest men on show , set the scene when he motored home from halfway .
     [java] 
     [java] Thirty four-year-old Alan Mercer from Lindford and Brian Rudman ( 23 ) from Whitehill are paddling all the way from Devizes to Westminster in a 125-mile canoe race .
     [java] 
     [java] Stan Weatherall and `` Darkie '' A. Harrison paddled their two-man canoe from Salen down the broad , rocky loch Sunart into the open sea on a clear day in February 1941 .
     [java] 
     [java] John told of his epic journey , when he pedalled 12,500 miles from Sydney back to Liverpool for charity .
     [java] 
     [java] Dervla Murphy has cycled from her home in Ireland to India and many places in between , and Bettina Selby has pedalled from the mouth to the source of the Nile .
     [java] 
     [java] Lowering her gaze from the intense sunlight reflected on the upper walls to the leaded doors , she placed a foot on the first stone step .
     [java] 
     [java] Irina gazed from Alexei to Jehana , and then back again .
     [java] 
     [java] Her laugh was so loud it attracted glances from people in the room .
     [java] 
     [java] He gave her a swift glance from those pale , brilliant eyes , but said nothing .
     [java] 
     [java] They would frequently receive strange glances from those in other booths but she just ignored it .
     [java] 
     [java] Lucinda glanced from Vi to Chief Wren Pillmoor , wondering who would be the victor .
     [java] 
     [java] A second later he was in the doorway , glancing from one to the other in concern .
     [java] 
     [java] Eleanor glanced from side to side and then said in a low voice , `` It 's all right what I told you about . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` I do n't see what I did different , '' he said , facing front to inspect the two of them in the mirror and then turning round to have a look from the side .
     [java] 
     [java] This can be particularly profitable as a fresh look from an outsider may reveal untapped sales potential and markets not recognised by the local estate agent .
     [java] 
     [java] There were concerned looks from burly matrons , and longing admiration from boys .
     [java] 
     [java] Charity exchanged a few pleasantries , then , at a look from her mother , excused herself to go off to the kitchen , leaving Leonora alone with Mrs Vaughan .

     [java] Once out of Kathmandu we started getting long stares from villagers , laying out spring wheat on the road to be threshed by passing cars and carts .
     [java] 
     [java] She now turned her smile on Millie , but she received no answering smile , only a stare from what she thought were those very odd grey eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] Benny shouted , drawing startled stares from some Marines .
     [java] 
     [java] Polly 's cheeks grew warm , then hot , as she became aware of frankly appraising stares from both men and women .
     [java] 
     [java] Staring balefully from the 30-year-old 's office wall are pictures of his six predecessors .
     [java] 
     [java] Patrick stared from one face to the other .
     [java] 
     [java] Being a 3D game , you can view objects from any angle , or indeed yourself !
     [java] 
     [java] Only they have had the chance to view the Earth from this unique vantage point -- until now .
     [java] 
     [java] The men led him down an alleyway , stinking from dog urine and heaps of excrement .
     [java] 
     [java] I had been working for more than an hour and my wrists ached from the continuous chopping , but I was filled with an immense exhilaration .
     [java] 
     [java] I got wearily to my feet , muscles aching from the effects of drink and walk .
     [java] 
     [java] She smiled , her jaw aching from the effort of holding back the tears .
     [java] 
     [java] His head was itching too much from the dreadful old grey wig .
     [java] 
     [java] He pushed past them frantically , his eyes smarting from the dust .
     [java] 
     [java] Jack stayed where he was , his face still smarting from the punch .
     [java] 
     [java] She blinked artificial eyelashes over wide , brown eyes that were smarting from the vanity of contact lenses .
     [java] 
     [java] To be honest I 'm still smarting from the various wounds she inflicted .
     [java] 
     [java] John 's face stung from the blow , he was speechless .
     [java] 
     [java] He sat forward and placed his hand on the pad , his palm still tingling from the effects of the shock .
     [java] 
     [java] Her hand rose to her lips , soft and still tingling from the hard pressure of his possessive mouth .
     [java] 
     [java] Ronni could feel her skin tingle from her scalp to her toes .
     [java] 
     [java] He sat beside her , close enough for her to feel the heat from his body .
     [java] 
     [java] She heard muffled groans from the corner of the room by the television .
     [java] 
     [java] His eyes were closed as he perceived pleasure from all of his senses , except that of sight .
     [java] 
     [java] But when we got there we found that the mountain we had perceived from the map to be the Cathedral , and which everyone else had perceived to be the Cathedral , was in fact another mountain altogether .
     [java] 
     [java] Stac Polly is an extraordinary mountain when seen from a distance and doubly so when one is engaged on the traverse of its narrow ridge .
     [java] 
     [java] They remained as they were ; in some fashion they were communing , and I could sense from my vantage point the necessity that linked them .
     [java] 
     [java] Sure enough , when they had dammed the lake and poured in all the wine and brandy from the barrels , hundreds of elephants came hasting through the mountains , having smelt the liquor from many miles away .

     [java] A cabin cruiser was chugging down the wide brown river towards that little harbour I 'd seen , and over the other side the bank was so steep that the rows of terraced houses were leaning over each other to get a view .
     [java] 
     [java] As the car chugged down the M1 motorway I stopped cursing my bad luck and thought of how we could have made the first descent if only we had concentrated on the job in hand and not got the press involved or told so many people all about our daring endeavour .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'll go , '' sobbed Perdita , and , leaping on to Hermia 's back , she clattered off down the drive .
     [java] 
     [java] Squeaky Sutton , the landlord of the `` Windy Ridge '' for the past thirty years , looked up as the noisy party clattered down the four steps into his cosy cellar bar .
     [java] 
     [java] The punt tipped over and started to clatter down the rollers the other side .
     [java] 
     [java] Willie rose and clattered down the hallway .
     [java] 
     [java] He says he experienced a tremendous thrill when he heard the tinkle of money and saw a glittering stream of silver coins clattering down the chute .
     [java] 
     [java] They rode in single file , for the ground became broken as they climbed higher and the hoofs of their mounts dislodged loose stones that clattered down the hillside .
     [java] 
     [java] Someone clattered down a wooden staircase .
     [java] 
     [java] It usually means clattering over ice and rocks down a three-foot-wide piste , in gale-force winds and horizontal rain .
     [java] 
     [java] You 're a fool , boy , '' he said , and clumped off down the hall .
     [java] 
     [java] Swedish feet in wooden sandals clumped down the stairs past his door , then up again , paused , knocked , said `` Telephone '' and continued back to their room .
     [java] 
     [java] Their feet clumped down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] I made myself very small as the stags crashed down the heathery , birch-studded hillside .
     [java] 
     [java] I watched in alarm as the rapidly rotating bundle crashed down the slope , jettisoning bits and pieces as it went .
     [java] 
     [java] On 18 May a magnitude 5 earthquake triggered a failure of the bulge and a huge landslide crashed down the mountain .
     [java] 
     [java] Chemicals gurgle down a drain straight into Hong Kong 's sewers .
     [java] 
     [java] `` All right , '' he said , his voice like water gurgling down a plughole .
     [java] 
     [java] The Waverley puttered down the still narrow river like a little terrier keen to get to the open fields of the Firth and the sea beyond .
     [java] 
     [java] Armoured personnel carriers rumble down streets that are normally home to Mercedes and convertible BMWs .
     [java] 
     [java] Once in our picturesque ski village , our friends were anxious to hire the gear and get straightaway into the serious business of descending headfirst down something snow-capped .
     [java] 
     [java] We descended immediately down the zig-zags of the north west face .
     [java] 
     [java] Having finished , she descends a little way down the twig and then lays another batch .
     [java] 
     [java] Some are in a state of imminent collapse and in others , side passages branch off in all directions and shafts can suddenly appear at your feet dropping down hundreds of feet into the darkness .
     [java] 
     [java] As she crept from her room and edged slowly down the stairs -- avoiding the most creaky -- she put from her mind any thought that Wakelate might follow her .
     [java] 
     [java] I ca n't recall , before , having had to peep through my fingers at Coronation Street as I did on Wednesday when Carmel , at the end of a riveting confrontation with Gail , plummeted down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] She thought again what a point of defence the tower was , commanding the countryside , and then she saw that there was a back road leading away from the tower , narrower , bumpier even than the drive to the front door , which snaked quickly down the hill and out of sight .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , for the last twenty minutes , the road snakes down the mountainside .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Rowse 's patients , forever winding down the path , oppressed Ken with the sense of his own age and mortality .
     [java] 
     [java] The path from Billy 's cottage wound down towards the river bank .
     [java] 
     [java] Cut into the sultry gold of his skin she saw a thin white line which zigzagged down from beside his eye , along his cheekbone , to his jaw .
     [java] 
     [java] A narrow path zigzagged steeply down from in front of the colonnade to the shore .
     [java] 
     [java] The trees are anchored by 20 metre polyurethane roots , formed by injecting liquid chemicals down a steel tube .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I parked down the road ''
     [java] 
     [java] The first people in each team place the keys down their neck and out through the bottom of their trouser legs or slacks .
     [java] 
     [java] Both boys began stuffing the empty cases down their shirts .
     [java] 
     [java] So after this meal , when I find I 'm stuffing foul non-rancid things down my throat -- without bad effects -- I try a quick scuttle round the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Sally took the strip of paper and stuffed it down the front of her skirt .
     [java] 
     [java] While I ca n't condone this sort of cheating Mr Unce , I have found two very good methods are tucking them down your sock or writing them on your shirt cuff .
     [java] 
     [java] The white men took away our land , '' she said tucking the coin down the front of her dirty dress , `` And now there is nowhere left to grow maize .
     [java] 
     [java] He appeared in July `` 85 , ambling down the 18th fairway at Royal St George 's .
     [java] 
     [java] He sighed and ambled down the corridor , whistling `` Hi-ho , hi-ho , '' under his breath .
     [java] 
     [java] He gave a shriek that should have woken the village ghosts , and bolted down the road , shivering puddles into glittering clouds around him .
     [java] 
     [java] He bolts off , down the wet lawn , without a backward glance .
     [java] 
     [java] The other three turned and bolted off down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] Louis came bounding down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] As Theda came out into the dark hall , she heard someone bustling down the stairs , and recognised Mrs Diggory 's voice .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Pigdon picked up the candle which had been ready to light him to bed from a shelf in an alcove by the door , and bustled past the visitor down the hall .
     [java] 
     [java] Reluctantly , and without much enthusiasm , Blair clambered down the river bank and waded across the stream .
     [java] 
     [java] He stepped over Gabriel 's knees and clambered down the ladder , mumbling .
     [java] 
     [java] She climbed down the dune and walked towards him .
     [java] 
     [java] We walked on until we reached an unlit stretch of the Corniche , then climbed over a low wall and down the short slope to the river 's edge where we were out of sight of the sentries .
     [java] 
     [java] She clomped down the steps in her ankle boots and blue woollen dress , and stood shyly beside Willie , twisting the hem of her dress in her hand till her knickers came into view .
     [java] 
     [java] The black-out happened on Monday night when vandals crawled down a 100-yard tunnel which carried eight 33,000-volt mains cables , dragging a lorry tyre which they then set on fire .
     [java] 
     [java] It crawls down the vine and enters the soil , whereupon it reaches and punctures the roots for nourishment .
     [java] 
     [java] Below him traffic crawled down Bond Street .
     [java] 
     [java] Rumour has it they 've been perfecting the belly crawl and crawling down rabbit holes to hide .
     [java] 
     [java] `` There 's a guy crawling down the wall up there , '' said I. `` You wan na take a look , Barry ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] I crawled down these stairs forty-eight years ago and I 've walked up and down them ever since , mostly in me bare feet , and I 've never got splinters . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I crept off down a little path through curling bracken .
     [java] 
     [java] The three of them began to creep slowly down the hill , moving from tree to tree , but no more than a few yards at a time .
     [java] 
     [java] What is an old woman 's heart when compared to the joys of dancing half naked down a catwalk while the world watches ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] She danced down them in almost weightless pirouettes to paths that wandered between the flower-beds .
     [java] 
     [java] She convulsed , collapsing to the floor with the pain that danced down the paths of her nervous system .
     [java] 
     [java] They danced wildly down the street , abandoning themselves to the night and the moon .
     [java] 
     [java] When he was certain they were not being followed he darted down a narrow , stinking court and knocked at a door .
     [java] 
     [java] For the trolley orderlies they are like a quick dash with a rickshaw down a Singapore street .
     [java] 
     [java] All the Shermans turned to watch in alarm as the captain dashed away down the companionway , dragging a revolver from inside his white uniform tunic .
     [java] 
     [java] Jenny dashed down the bank to the river and pulled off her shoes and socks .
     [java] 
     [java] I dashed out down the street to the pub to get him round to the cottage before Mr Vulcan changed his mind .
     [java] 
     [java] The IB is already hastening down this path .
     [java] 
     [java] She hurried across the bridge and down the path , then climbed the wooden steps up on to the terrace .
     [java] 
     [java] Carrie smiled at him and hurried down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car .
     [java] 
     [java] McLeish jogged down the passage , overcoming irritation .
     [java] 
     [java] Meanwhile Captain Bill Pritchard and his corporal -- a Scots engineer apprentice , Mac , I.L. Maclagan -- jogged silently down the lock 's east wall but found none of the expected demolitions at its gates .
     [java] 
     [java] They jogged slowly down the hill .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 've knitted you a tracksuit , dear -- now you 'll be able to jog down to the shop when I need more yarn . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I jogged down the stairs while he began to argue with the builders .
     [java] 
     [java] The flight was early and almost immediately she saw him , loping down the side of the moving walkway , noticeably more gaunt and suntanned than the youth who had left barely ten days earlier .
     [java] 
     [java] Tim loped off down an alleyway lined with pet food , and halted before a tier of shelves of bottles , brown and red bottles , ochre and copper and olive-green .
     [java] 
     [java] The Asian security man unlocked the door to the documentary department office and loped off down the corridor with a distracted smile on his face .
     [java] 
     [java] Oh , sure , he quivers on slippery poles as tall as the moon is high , and lopes nude down tunnels while alarm-clocks sound , etc -- but there are no worrying resonances .
     [java] 
     [java] He had been disappointed to find Dr Ockleton absent from his rooms in the morning , but a pretty girl in jogging kit , who had come loping down the stairs whilst he was knocking at Ockleton 's door , had run on the spot long enough to tell him that the doctor lectured on Tuesday mornings and that Harry would probably have better luck after lunch .
     [java] 
     [java] Impatiently he watched him lumber blindly down the steep narrow staircase and when the bridegroom reached the bottom , Burden said curtly :
     [java] 
     [java] It was indeed an ambulance : a field ambulance , boldly redcrossed , lumbering down the track .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Slowly , but very deliberately , the brooding edifice of seduction , creaking and incongruous , came into being , a vast Heath Robinson mechanism , dually controlled by us and lumbering gloomily down vistas of triteness .
     [java] 
     [java] A battered Model T Ford , mounted with a shining machine gun , flying an unrecognisable flag , was lumbering down the street , pushing people and stalls before it .
     [java] 
     [java] The armies that came to Lebanon marched down a long , dull tunnel that inevitably ended in brown smoke and pieces of flesh .
     [java] 
     [java] He marched down the steps .
     [java] 
     [java] A Scottish battalion was marching down the street , its pace dictated by the soft beat of a muffled drum .
     [java] 
     [java] The tall boy turned away and began to pace away down the hill .
     [java] 
     [java] `` As I padded down the passage to the kitchen , I felt that something was wrong .
     [java] 
     [java] They padded down the backstairs .
     [java] 
     [java] I rolled out of the upper berth and padded down the corridor to the bathroom .
     [java] 
     [java] They padded down a series of passages that criss-crossed like a maze .
     [java] 
     [java] So it was a quietly defiant Alistair who , the next morning , came plodding down the stairs , and glanced at the splayed mail on the shelf as he headed for the door .
     [java] 
     [java] She ushered them into deep leather chairs , offered Edward a copy of the Financial Times ( which he took , cravenly ) and pranced off down a corridor .
     [java] 
     [java]  Down rushed all the wine and brandy , straight down the side of the mountain so that the king , and his palace , and his wicked minister Milosu were all swept away .
     [java] 
     [java] Now he suddenly reappeared , clad in nothing but a pair of nankeen trousers , rushing down the stairs and levelling a pistol at my head !
     [java] 
     [java] She rushed down the corridor , through the kitchen , out of the back door to the shed and ran back with the barrow and the spade clattering on top .
     [java] 
     [java] He rushed down the stairs and Philip ran after him , his arms out like a plane too .
     [java] 
     [java] Duvall was already pulling open one of the main doors when Rohmer and the others rushed down the corridor towards them .
     [java] 
     [java] Maud went rushing off down the corridor , but Mildred stopped and looked out of the window to see if there was any evidence of fire .
     [java] 
     [java] Why do some women see marriage as an absolute priority from the start of a relationship , yet others would n't sashay down the aisle if their lives depended on it ?
     [java] 
     [java] She ran past the Library to the corner of Unter den Linden and saw Karl , notable in his elegant overcoat , sauntering down the street .
     [java] 
     [java] Diana Ross sauntered down the catwalk this season wearing little more than a feather boa and a smile .
     [java] 
     [java] When he tried to upstage her she sauntered down to the front of the stage and such was her control over the audience now , he had to back off , otherwise it would have been he who looked ridiculous .
     [java] 
     [java] She hurried downstage and scampered down the makeshift gangway to the auditorium floor .
     [java] 
     [java] I forgot eggs , '' he called , and scampered off down the stairs to get some from an early dairy around the corner .
     [java] 
     [java] Scooting down the side-aisle , she ducked past him and out of the shop , where she continued to run blindly until she was caught up against a solid chest .
     [java] 
     [java] A steep scramble down an ivy-covered slope leads one into a place of great natural beauty alive with the earth spirit force .
     [java] 
     [java] The four men looked up as he came scrambling down the steep bank .
     [java] 
     [java] The pictures , Britta realized , were the views seen by the Counsellors as they scrambled down the slope towards the wrecked craft .
     [java] 
     [java] Then fear overcame curiosity and he scrambled down from the tree with such haste that he skinned his knees and gouged a long deep gash along the inside of his forearm .
     [java] 
     [java] He scrambled down from his chair and looked hopefully at Nick , and when he said , `` Do you mean you want us to come and help milk the cow ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] The other scurried down the garden path towards Meredith .
     [java] 
     [java] A rat as big as a cat scurried down a steep slope and a small bush slid down after it in the torrential downpour .
     [java] 
     [java] Instead of the usual friendly salutations , he scuttled away down the alleyway to sell his information to men like Waller and others to whom I owed debts .
     [java] 
     [java] I became aware that feet were scuttling down the stairs , and my father was bellowing from the regions below , `` For God 's sake , come down ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] When Eric Cantona , having completed his first full 90 minutes , embraced Mark Hughes at the end of this significant victory , it was apt that McClair should quietly shuffle down the tunnel .
     [java] 
     [java] Josh shuffled off down the lip of the basin still sieving the water .
     [java] 
     [java] A young girl skips down the steep path with a small sack of potatoes .
     [java] 
     [java] Skipping down old moraine we reached the banks of the Shyok , more than 160 miles above our last crossing point .
     [java] 
     [java] Carrie sang too , as she skipped down the railway track ; sang under her breath and laughed to herself .
     [java] 
     [java] My eye skips down the page .
     [java] 
     [java] He skipped down the steps as happily as any boy .
     [java] 
     [java] I skulked down one side of the garden and went through the arch which led me to a walled garden in the middle of which there was a fountain playing .
     [java] 
     [java] The creature slithered away down the corridor .
     [java] 
     [java] Five minutes later he had slithered down the sandy cliffs , a mug of tea slopping in each hand .
     [java] 
     [java] She hardly felt the cuts and scratches as she slithered down the rocky path to the Cove .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he was climbing back up the bank he had slithered down and I watched as he walked in a leisurely fashion across the slope of the mountain to the gully .
     [java] 
     [java] Benjamin and I slithered down the bank .
     [java] 
     [java] An expression of pure horror shaped itself on his features as he slithered helplessly down the slope and plunged headlong into the stinking waters of Mucky Beck .
     [java] 
     [java] Turning , with my back to the hillside for a minute , I watch the red dragon of tail-lights slithering tightly down the valley .
     [java] 
     [java] Her frantic anxiety gave Marie extra strength : it was only her brute force that dragged the drum back when it skidded off the path and began to slither over the grass down towards the channel .
     [java] 
     [java] And Marigot Bay undoubtedly fell into the former category , she reflected , sipping more orange juice and letting the zingy citrus sweetness slither cold and reviving down her throat .
     [java] 
     [java] With his video recorder still running , he dashed outside to see a youth sprinting down Kingston Street in the Corporation Road area .
     [java] 
     [java] Earlier , the full-back , apparently incensed at being called off just three minutes into the second half , turned away from the bench and sprinted straight down the tunnel .
     [java] 
     [java] Cambridge increased their lead on the half-hour when Simms intercepted an ambitious cut-out pass by Smith inside his own half and sprinted 70 yards down centre-field to score between the posts .
     [java] 
     [java] A flailing chimera of camera crews , photographers and reporters staggers backwards down some city high street .
     [java] 
     [java] Then Vernage noticed Sergeant King staggering down the road in a desperate bid to flag down a car .
     [java] 
     [java] He picked himself up and staggered down a corridor .
     [java] 
     [java] He paused for a while to compose himself then staggered down to the porter 's lodge .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I said , `` Get lost '' , and pushed past him and staggered off down the corridor .
     [java] 
     [java] The sepoy staggered off , clutching at the violin strings , out of the music-room and down the corridor with Fleury still on his back .
     [java] 
     [java] He stamped away down one of the corridors .
     [java] 
     [java] As her mother stamped away down the drive Peggy stared after her .
     [java] 
     [java] He tightened his dressing-gown cord around him and stamped down the stairs to the next landing .
     [java] 
     [java] She pictured the man stamping down through his pub , irate and duty-bound .
     [java] 
     [java] And I , maybe I 'm , I may be wrong on this , but it does seem to me that it is potentially a step down the road , in the longer term to the development of regional members .
     [java] 
     [java] Darius stomps down the three steps without saying a word .
     [java] 
     [java] And got heavier as they left the small station and straggled down a steep , cinder path .
     [java] 
     [java] Jimmy was striding away down the corridor , his shoulders hunched up .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Happens , '' he said gruffly , patting her gingerly on the shoulder , and striding down the track ahead of her .
     [java] 
     [java] She strode down the aisle towards the front of the nave her footsteps brisk .
     [java] 
     [java] He left her then and strode down towards the town , surprised at the force of the night breeze sharp against his skin .
     [java] 
     [java] He strode off down one of the aisles .
     [java] 
     [java] Alec strode down Dame Street , impatient to be home .
     [java] 
     [java] Come Sunday you 'll enjoy a stroll down Memory Lane to re-live if not recapture some of the golden moments you 've shared with the ones you love .
     [java] 
     [java] They strolled down the cobbled streets past the little white houses , enjoying the sea breeze until they reached the bay .
     [java] 
     [java] He strolled down the road , thinking , and not for the first time , what a remarkably quiet and empty road Church Row was .
     [java] 
     [java] Forget about strolling down to the shops to get a newspaper or sauntering in the park with the family on Sundays .
     [java] 
     [java] I strolled on down the edge of the ninth fairway in the gradually strengthening sun .
     [java] 
     [java] Delighted to have her company , Harry linked his arm through hers and they strolled in a leisurely fashion down the shady drive .
     [java] 
     [java]  Down the road , three guys strut along dressed in full Clockwise Orange gear -- white long johns , jock straps , black bowlers and canes .
     [java] 
     [java] It was all too much , waiting for that upstart Hitler to make up his mind ; to envisage the Germans strutting down the Mall as they 'd strutted down the Champs Elysees .
     [java] 
     [java] It was all too much , waiting for that upstart Hitler to make up his mind ; to envisage the Germans strutting down the Mall as they 'd strutted down the Champs Elysees .
     [java] 
     [java] Slowed by the blossoming pain in his injured leg , he supported himself with a hand on the rough stone wall and stumbled down the remaining few steps .
     [java] 
     [java] He saluted her , went through the screen door , vaulted the balustrade protecting the steps , and swaggered down the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] Dexter was abnormally silent as he swaggered down the drive .
     [java] 
     [java] of the other man swaggering down the road ?
     [java] 
     [java] When the divers went over the side to swim down the seventy feet to the pipe , however , they immediately discovered how hazardous it really was .
     [java] 
     [java] NEW Yorkers awoke yesterday to find boats in their front gardens and neighbours swimming down their street after the region 's worst storm in decades .
     [java] 
     [java] I swam down the coast , carried by the current .
     [java] 
     [java] Summoning all her reserves , she swam forcefully down the whole length of the pool , and back again , gradually realising that she felt fitter than she had done for ages .
     [java] 
     [java] I expect the crew had tiptoed down very gently from the bunk above while he slept .
     [java] 
     [java] He wound his way through us as we sat fascinated at the sight as Geordie tiptoed down the beach towards the sea , his top part a deep tan , from the waist down a dirty white colour .
     [java] 
     [java] They tiptoe down and see that he 's got it open , all right , but he 's lying there dead .
     [java] 
     [java] She dressed swiftly , then slipped out the door from his apartment into the silence of the sleeping palazzo and tiptoed stealthily down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] From then on , every afternoon , as soon as her mother had left for bingo , Matilda would toddle down to the library .
     [java] 
     [java] His favourite relaxation was to toddle down to the quay and join the Royal Navy patrol boat for a day out .
     [java] 
     [java] When I see a woman in a long , tight , pencil skirt and high heels tottering down the road , I often wonder how fast she could run if chased .
     [java] 
     [java] As Magee watched she tottered down the steps and wandered off down Duncannon Street in the direction of the Strand .
     [java] 
     [java] Thousands of miners are leaving their small terraced houses and tramping down the street to one or another of the 20 coal mines in the Rhondda valleys .
     [java] 
     [java] She was tempted to tramp noisily down so that if Shildon had lingered he would be scared away , but then she would never know whether he had been there .
     [java] 
     [java] But it was the ideal stuff to lay up against the sides of the hole and tramp down into the base , where it soaked up water like a loofah .
     [java] 
     [java] They trod carefully down a rocky path which he would never have spotted had he not been walking on it .
     [java] 
     [java] I can see him now , treading down the soil , making shallow drills and sprinkling the seed , and watching anxiously several weeks later to see if they had germinated .
     [java] 
     [java] Yes , there were gateways here in this Castle , where midnight footsteps trod purposefully down the halls
     [java] 
     [java] Taking great care where she placed her feet , she trod softly down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] I tripped back down the curving stairs , half-expecting a Busby Berkeley chorus to break into song .
     [java] 
     [java] Failing that they had to trudge down the nearest side streets with their suitcases , knock on doors at random asking whether they took theatricals .
     [java] 
     [java] He trudged off miserably down jubilee Road with the cold rain dripping from his ear lobes .
     [java] 
     [java] That evening , in his small black police car , Baldwin trundled again down the new arterial road through the western suburbs for another uneasy interview at Fort Belvedere .
     [java] 
     [java] This will be easily demonstrated by watching one of these lorries trundling down the Ormeau Road and through the centre of town .
     [java] 
     [java] The barbarian had vaulted down into the heather and had drawn the black sword , Kring .
     [java] 
     [java] Putting his hand to a crumbling step , he vaulted down to the ground and landed running .
     [java] 
     [java] The man sighed and , choosing a key from a ring which hung round his fat waist , waddled down a narrow , dimly-lit passage past a number of cells .
     [java] 
     [java] On seeing them waddle down the street , like a mass of quivering flesh , we usually ran upstairs to warn Mum of the advancing horde .
     [java] 
     [java] I found the cafe depressing , and walked to the open door and watched a goose waddle down the lane , her goslings in obedi Indian file .
     [java] 
     [java] Sir John groaned as he eased his bulk up and sorrowfully waddled down to the aroma-filled kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] A quick walk down Coronation Street was followed by a few pints of Newton and Ridley Ale before we departed .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , still feeling uptight , she left the hotel and took a brief walk down Hlavny T , the main street .
     [java] 
     [java] So if anyone wants company for a walk down Memory Lane , I will gladly go with them .
     [java] 
     [java] After a while she wandered away down to St Saviour 's Point .
     [java] 
     [java] Wander down a meandering lane past a fisherman 's cottage , shops , workshops and yards .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We could both wander down , perhaps , if the rain stops .
     [java] 
     [java] He let his mind wander down the twenty yards of landing and the three stairs to the back bedroom where his sixteen-year-old daughter lay .
     [java] 
     [java] At the time , I was far from alone in wondering if he had not wandered further down that path than he knew , whether the playboy and gilded youth had not taken over from the redoubtable fighter .
     [java] 
     [java] As the train thundered over a set of points he steadied himself against her seat for a moment , then wandered off down the aisle .
     [java] 
     [java] The guard biked down the drive and checked it out ''
     [java] 
     [java] Sick of talk , we cycled down the green tunnel
     [java] 
     [java] '' I 'm off home , She waved and cycled off down the High Street .
     [java] 
     [java] Yanto cycled on down the wharf , dodging the mooring ropes until he arrived at the berth of a small Norwegian timber boat called `` Marit , '' registered in Oslo .
     [java] 
     [java] He cycled down the track to a junction a mile further on .
     [java] 
     [java] Every few weeks I would get one or two days off duty to catch the ferry to Nanaimo and motor down the scenic Malahat Drive to Victoria .
     [java] 
     [java] This time it is the author and her husband paddling an open canoe down the river for four months in 1984 .
     [java] 
     [java] At the London final , where they were interviewed by Gloria Hunniford , one contender wanted to paddle down the Amazon and another wanted to climb Kilimanjaro .
     [java] 
     [java] A SCHOOLBOY was robbed of his mountain bike as he pedalled down the hard shoulder of a motorway to get help after his dad 's car broke down .
     [java] 
     [java] Matata poled gracefully ; he could have been punting down the Cam as his pole pushed blue and white water lilies aside .
     [java] 
     [java] No one forced Francoise Jacquier to spend 10 days crossing Central America 's highest mountain , tramping through jungles inhabited by some of the world 's deadliest snakes or rafting down swollen rivers .
     [java] 
     [java] Elizabeth had recently spent three weeks rafting down the Zambesi River with her South African fiance Cuan Cronje .
     [java] 
     [java] This is a story about rafting down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon , about running America 's biggest rapids .
     [java] 
     [java] And over the next 3 days , all their training and stamina was put to the supreme test as the rafts were rowed down river .
     [java] 
     [java] We rowed eastwards down the river all day , looking round all the time to check that no one was following us .
     [java] 
     [java] I skate down the road a bit before I shout at cops -- or anyone that was giving me some shit .
     [java] 
     [java] ONE of the most charming sights of winter comprises a family of otters `` sledging '' down a snow-covered bank into the river .
     [java] 
     [java] The aircraft landed at Cannon International Airport and were taxied down city streets to the auction site .
     [java] 
     [java] Left foot forwards , knees slightly bent , I rode the board down that precipitous slope like a man tobogganing down a glacier .
     [java] 
     [java] A list was always made on these occasions and Pascoe glanced quickly down it .
     [java] 
     [java] He growled , groped his way down the pitch dark corridor and found her almost by instinct .
     [java] 
     [java] But then she got married and we lived down the road there for a while till they repaired these , they made these There was very old houses these are .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The man who lives down the street at No. 23 .
     [java] 
     [java] A BLIND man fought off a bull terrier that attacked his guide dog -- by jamming his fist down its throat and smacking it between the eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] It was extended to Deanshanger in 1888 , but this only lasted a year and then it was closed , as was the track down Creed Street to the Wolverton Goods Yard in 1893 .
     [java] 
     [java] He gave a shriek that should have woken the village ghosts , and bolted down the road , shivering puddles into glittering clouds around him .
     [java] 
     [java] Shoving the letter inside her book Emily had humped her bicycle down the steps and hurriedly pedalled off towards Kensington High Street .
     [java] 
     [java] It is after all a dealers ' fair and gives us a chance to show what we have to potential and established clients without the auction houses breathing down our necks .
     [java] 
     [java] We fled down a long avenue towards the river .
     [java] 
     [java] That afternoon we made a laborious but uneventful descent down the north east face and retrieved our skis .
     [java] 
     [java] Children in the congregation watched the diamonds slowly grow squarer , less elongated , as the sun moved down the sky .
     [java] 
     [java] The rain dripped down his neck .
     [java] 
     [java] Trickles of sweat dripped from her hair and down her temples , leaving an itchy heat behind them .
     [java] 
     [java] In these the small rivers flow down quite steep channels , or gradients ( e.g. 1 : 40 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Tears were flowing down my face .
     [java] 
     [java] Tears flowed suddenly down Lais 's face as she saw the ugly swastika flag already flying over the German HQ at the Hotel Crillon .
     [java] 
     [java] Delaney turned from the rain trickling down the window .
     [java] 
     [java] In spite of the rain trickling down our necks , our spirits lifted .
     [java] 
     [java] Their lungs rasped from the effort , the rain trickled down their foreheads to mix with the sweat , their energy gone .
     [java] 
     [java] Sweat trickled down his inner arms , formed on his forehead .
     [java] 
     [java] But one runnel of sweat began to trickle down his forehead from under his headdress .
     [java] 
     [java] Tears trickled down the cheeks of some stout veterans .
     [java] 
     [java] Here and there the open doors of furnaces glowed a dangerous red , and in the far corner of the building what looked like a stream of molten lava trickled down a curved channel from roof to floor .
     [java] 
     [java] It collects in a pool near the gate , thence it trickles down the road .
     [java] 
     [java] But with the industry in recession , and record sales dropping , the hitherto dependable cashflow was trickling down at an alarming rate .
     [java] 
     [java] When it rained the water would cascade down the banks and wash great lumps of soil into the road .
     [java] 
     [java] His tongue tasted like water cascading down the side of a mountain , fresh and clean beyond imagining .
     [java] 
     [java] She could see waterfalls cascading down some of the mountain-sides and in the distance a lake .
     [java] 
     [java] Her stabbing nails had torn his left upper eyelid and blood from the wound dribbled down the side of his face , some of it running across the orb itself , turning one half of his world crimson .
     [java] 
     [java] His gob of saliva dribbled down then clung , warping the image of the turtle head as though the corresponding section of the enemy Titan was bubbling , rheum leaking from its right eye .
     [java] 
     [java] He paused , the butt of his cigar held against his brow , so that a cataract of white spume dribbled down into his eye socket .
     [java] 
     [java] Rainwater dribbled down her temples and the back of her neck .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's early evening in Leicester Square and the rain is splashing down .
     [java] 
     [java] Alexandra suddenly found she was crying , great gulping sobs , tears splashing down on to the kitchen counter , an aching sense of something very precious which she had discarded without even a second glance .
     [java] 
     [java] His trousers were ripped and the blood seeped down his leg from the gash inches above his knee .
     [java] 
     [java] A third had a bloodstained rag bound round his forehead like a sweatband , from under which blood was seeping and trickling down the left side of his face .
     [java] 
     [java] On the shelf below him the old man was vomiting again , too weak even to roll over so that blood and mucus oozed down his chin and neck , some of it bubbling back into his throat .
     [java] 
     [java] Above this floor , rain soaks down to recharge an aquifer .
     [java] 
     [java] I remember a tear running down my cheek and me trying to smile it away .
     [java] 
     [java] As a tear began to run down his lined face , he pulled the heavy old chain and watched as the water gushed down on the spider .
     [java] 
     [java] Her eyes were as dark as a rotten egg , and a tear of blood ran down alongside her nose to the corner of her mouth like a symptom of regret .
     [java] 
     [java] Nathan moaned helplessly , tears running down his face .
     [java] 
     [java] Now the tears were running down the woman 's cheeks unchecked .
     [java] 
     [java] Two enormous tears welled out of Pickerage 's eyes and ran rapidly down his cheeks , followed by others .
     [java] 
     [java] His hand hurt , his mouth ached with the expression of tense anguish he knew he wore , water ran from his hair , over his face , down his back .
     [java] 
     [java] He answered Buckmaster 's question as he turned off the road between lodge gates and proceeded down the long drive across open parkland .
     [java] 
     [java] He proceeded down the wooden stairs and Athelstan went along the gallery and up to the garret .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Telford , of Wheatley , Doncaster , could hear appeals to give himself up -- but his replies were drowned by the noise of air rushing down the shaft .
     [java] 
     [java] In the end we just stood holding each other close , as the tears coursed down our faces .
     [java] 
     [java] Water coursed down Simon 's body as he stood , shaking with cold , on the beam .
     [java] 
     [java] Inevitably the road worsened as we neared the pass , the surface rutted by trucks and still awash with water spilling down steep gullies .
     [java] 
     [java] Blood streamed down his face and back .
     [java] 
     [java] Wull shouted , tears streaming down his cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] So they sat on a blanket and clung to each other , tears streaming down their cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] I just ca n't s-seem to help it , '' she wept , unable to staunch the heavy flow of tears streaming down her pale cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] Come on , come on , he thought , and pictured the three of them plummeting down the last thirty feet into the basement .
     [java] 
     [java] Potter made straight for the peak and plummeted down the perpendicular drop : the lip curled over him and he was inside the tube .
     [java] 
     [java] The Friar plunged down into the ravine and toiled up the other side .
     [java] 
     [java] When they die , often due to punctures received during the rutting season , they deflate and plunge down to earth , exploding as they strike the Tarmac .
     [java] 
     [java] Unless you have women 's bodies floating down this part of the river all the time . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It coasted down the mud walls and sploshed into the channel .
     [java] 
     [java] I plugged my naked feet in between the empty seats as tears rolled down my cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] Mostyn 's M-29 spat , and somebody rolled down the dunes .
     [java] 
     [java] Immediately after the blast the victim 's car rolled down hill and struck another car occupied by a woman .
     [java] 
     [java] Catherine sobbed quietly , hiding her face in his shoulder , and tears rolled down Heathcliff 's dark face .
     [java] 
     [java] As Tamar placed him in his grandmother 's arms , tears rolled down the older woman 's cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] Julie turned and headed back across the landing , down the short corridor towards the office .
     [java] 
     [java] I slipped out of bed , got into a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and headed down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] In no time at all they were coasting down the slope out of the car park .
     [java] 
     [java] I ca n't afford to keep chucking two quid down the drain .
     [java] 
     [java] He kicked it open and flung me down the three steps into the street .
     [java] 
     [java] Shales picked up one of the newspapers in front of him and pitched it down the table in Dowd 's direction .
     [java] 
     [java] They claim that the huge crop will push down prices , and this , coupled with cheap imported plums from Spain will mean it simply wo n't be worth picking the fruits .
     [java] 
     [java] The same bottle you 'd shoved halfway down his throat ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` ALL I remember was the sudden transition from abseiling , to being battered and pummelled and thrown violently down the mountain .
     [java] 
     [java] Working frantically and fast Franca dragged her clothes out of the wardrobe , carried them onto the landing and threw them down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] As he had already thrown the scotch down his throat , Neville refilled his glass .
     [java] 
     [java] At what are called destructive' plate margins , the surface material of one plate is subducted ( that is , thrust down ) beneath the surface material of the adjacent plate , rejoining the molten rock of the mantle .
     [java] 
     [java] The car was tossed 20 yards down the line and Swales , 27 , his sister Louise , 24 , and girlfriend Maria Garbutt , 28 , died instantly .
     [java] 
     [java] Dress up as a gorilla and chase people down Sunset Strip .
     [java] 
     [java] Freddy Krueger is chasing you down an alley , his knives raised menacingly .
     [java] 
     [java] Patsy , shrieking with laughter , chased him down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] One morning Jamie conducted him down two flights of stairs and into a long high apartment , like a baronial hall .
     [java] 
     [java] Instead he fairly hustled his big body along , as if it were a laggardly prisoner he was escorting down death row .
     [java] 
     [java] A few minutes later , Chrissie had moved the cat 's body round to the back of the house , and was escorting her two weeping children down the garden to where Anne Hanvey waited in the school car .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm quite hungry for some breakfast , '' said Snodgrass , as they followed Caspar along the galleries and down the staircases and through huge , high-ceilinged chambers .
     [java] 
     [java] He opened a door into a corridor and I followed him down it .
     [java] 
     [java] I followed him out the door and down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] One of the most hardline speeches was by V. Shabonov , a factory foreman from Saratov , who told the plenum : '' A few scientists , informal groups , various nationalities and black marketeers have led the country down the road to bourgeois reforms , restoration of private property , political anarchy and the destruction of the party as a workers ' vanguard .
     [java] 
     [java] The butler led him down the hall to a veneered door which he opened .
     [java] 
     [java] The trail he was on led down to another valley , running at right angles to this one and bifurcated by a tumbling mountain stream that glittered in the afternoon sun .
     [java] 
     [java] Six Broadstairs matrons attempting to shop at Marchesi 's the confectioners , two errand boys buying bloaters from Mr Goodman the fishmonger , a few afternoon revellers strolling out from the Dolphin Inn and an eager group from the Tourist Cycling Club staying at the Balmoral Bijou Hotel found themselves swept along with the crowd as they pursued their leaders down Harbour Street under the ancient York Gate ( which being without specific Dickensian associations hardly received a glance ) .
     [java] 
     [java] The gardener , Mrs Grindlewood-Gryke and I pursued him down the garden and into the bluebell wood .
     [java] 
     [java] Your voice pursued me down the marble stairway :
     [java] 
     [java] Doug disappeared down the stairs , indicating that he did n't want Jamieson to accompany him .
     [java] 
     [java] He gave a brief nod , and swung himself down the companionway .
     [java] 
     [java] Joy and Alan came back , and it was decided that we would wait until dark and then bring him down the fire escape ; luckily there was one right next to his room .
     [java] 
     [java] Greg retreated a short way down the path , and the Fire Officer turned back to the operation .
     [java] 
     [java] The damp retreated down the walls , the gardens came back to life and there was fresh food in the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] Terry was standing at the landing window , Rose just retreating down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] He came over , shoved the piece of paper into my hand , and vanished down the same hole .

     [java] She sprang up , knocking over her coffee-cup in the process , and clutched Robyn by the shoulders .
     [java] 
     [java] The queen smiled and tweaked me gently by the cheek .
     [java] 
     [java] One day we were crouching by the gardener 's bonfire ( his pride was that the fire smouldered day and night and never went out ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Michele was crouching by her side , his face taut .
     [java] 
     [java] Huddling by the fire he waited impatiently for daylight and his relief .
     [java] 
     [java] Nicholas knelt by the body .
     [java] 
     [java] He kneels by my head , grinning .
     [java] 
     [java] She knelt by the trunk , flinging aside papers , reaching down and down , scrabbling in the corners .
     [java] 
     [java] He put out his arm , so that she could lie by him , inside it , but she felt treacherous and untruthful , for he would not have liked what she was thinking .
     [java] 
     [java] But what was the agonised cry and the figure lying by the line side ?
     [java] 
     [java] To finish in style , we spent a luxurious four days in Palm Springs -- lying by the pool -- in temperatures of 120C , just enough to finish off the tan .
     [java] 
     [java] I now sat by her bedside and worked out ratios .
     [java] 
     [java] And this time there was a woman sitting by the fire .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm looking forward to getting back home and sitting by the fire .
     [java] 
     [java] But one day , as he sat by a mountain stream , he actually looked at a flower , and for the first time in ten years he realized how beautiful something living could be .
     [java] 
     [java] The taxi driver was squatting by one of Bonefish 's gateposts where he surreptitiously smoked a cigarette .
     [java] 
     [java] Nick looked across the room to where a fat man in jeans stood by the bar and ticked the side of his forehead like a taxi driver acknowledging a tip .
     [java] 
     [java] She stood by the glittering bottles and looked at him expectantly .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It 's Peach , '' whispered Leonore , standing by the door .
     [java] 
     [java] For the second show their Captain stood by the pianist and rapped out the rhythm .
     [java] 
     [java] I stood by the railings and looked across the remains of the grass to where the dyke used to be .

     [java] It is this which makes a patterned woven carpet something special , a point not always understood by the customer .
     [java] 
     [java] All these were chance discoveries by scientists engaged in other pursuits .
     [java] 
     [java] Recent discoveries by Cambridge University paleontologists have revealed that the prehistoric creatures that roamed the primeval oceans were even stranger and more varied than we can imagine .
     [java] 
     [java] This calculation was made possible by the recent discovery by nutritionists of the relationship between diet and health .
     [java] 
     [java] He recognized them by the bright overalls they wore .
     [java] 
     [java] You 'll recognise good retailers by their thoroughness .
     [java] 
     [java] It showed how categorisation by discipline installations , painting , photography and so on can still work effectively as a way of organising an exhibition .
     [java] 
     [java] This allows the information officer to categorise topics by a key word , by category , by author or by title .
     [java] 
     [java] After detailed examination of the information fields , it was felt that it would be possible to categorise them by type as a basis for selecting areas for further study .
     [java] 
     [java] The figure ( bottom ) shows survival categorised by age group .
     [java] 
     [java] Persistent and casual truants -- so categorised by headteachers -- made up 4% of the school roll in November and 5% in June .
     [java] 
     [java] Classification by audience age has proved an acceptable limitation to impose on a cinema audience , and may also warn of the type of experience on offer .
     [java] 
     [java] Classification by computer , howsoever sophisticated the algorithm , is not appropriate .
     [java] 
     [java] All histological tumour sections were reclassified according to the 1987 updated tumour node metastasis classification by one of the authors ( FB ) .
     [java] 
     [java] McAlpine and Cook evaluated these results by classifying the derived polygons by size and boundary complexity .
     [java] 
     [java] Unfortunately , the funboards people tend to classify their level by the type of board they sail rather than how well they sail it .
     [java] 
     [java] Almost 80 per cent of an estimated 17,000,000 refugees in the world were in the 47 countries classified by the UN as LDCs .
     [java] 
     [java] But I should stress that this is still very much a personal interpretation by somebody only marginally involved in the market .
     [java] 
     [java] The difference between the arm and leg is thus due to the different interpretation by the cells of the same positional signals .
     [java] 
     [java] Young readers are at least as good as older readers at this process of `` realization '' -- and are usually more ready to challenge interpretations by illustrators , actors , or story-tellers as `` wrong '' .
     [java] 
     [java] This humanistic attention to the subjective interpretation by prisoners of their situation marks a distinct departure from the orthodox account .
     [java] 
     [java] I also sent him an article entitled `` Interpretation by Economics '' .
     [java] 
     [java] The Constitution , in short , is subject to interpretation by different bodies , the most prominent being politicians , judges , and scholars .
     [java] 
     [java] Insufficient consideration by whom ?
     [java] 
     [java] Many of these problems can be overcome given a modicum of sympathy and consideration by those in authority but , unfortunately , ignorance of these diseases and their consequences is still widespread , even among health professionals .
     [java] 
     [java] The creation of a pan-European Community deserves the most serious consideration by the Twelve .
     [java] 
     [java] The position and problems of the Free Representation Unit have recently come under consideration by the committees of the Bar Council .
     [java] 
     [java] Lord Taylor said that the whole of the evidence merited consideration by a fresh jury .
     [java] 
     [java] The split decision , arrived at after almost two hours deliberation by the panel , reflected the complexity of the two-day hearing during which shocking allegations were made about what life was like for residents in the Colchester hospital .
     [java] 
     [java] After a long deliberation by the jury , Mr Dodd was cleared of wilfully avoiding tax on the considerable sums of money he had hidden , but had to pay large amounts of tax considered owing , as well as legal costs .
     [java] 
     [java] Dot guessed by the papery men lurking inside the walls that she must be ill .
     [java] 
     [java] First , the agreement that risk should pass independently from property was not express but inferred by the court from the circumstances of the case .
     [java] 
     [java] Another way of learning vocabulary by direct association is to participate in local activities , and find out the names of objects , actions , processes , etc. , '' on the job '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Though we learned them by word of mouth , of course .
     [java] 
     [java] There is no doubt that children learn far more by example than by precept , and therefore that teachers have a continuous obligation to behave well themselves .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Major learned by his predecessor 's mistake .
     [java] 
     [java] The pupils learn by trial and error , by using the programs in context .
     [java] 
     [java] This will be forthcoming only if there is full discussion between the universities and all concerned with the pre-registration year , and a realisation by all of the importance of the year to the young doctor . ''
     [java] 
     [java] This would be evidence against the present finding that identification with the housewife role is not differentiated by class .
     [java] 
     [java] However , the financial system consists of many types of institution , differentiated by the services that they offer to lenders and borrowers .
     [java] 
     [java] The result is a range of different genres of literary criticism and literary theory , to some extent distinguished by register .
     [java] 
     [java] They suggested that the title might be the cause of a lack of appreciation by the funders , the local authorities , of the complexity , responsibility and professionalism now required of the post holder .
     [java] 
     [java] She had been held in high esteem by numerous people who all wanted to pay their respect .
     [java] 
     [java] But during her short acting career , Brown was held in high esteem by the theatrical fraternity in Northern Ireland .
     [java] 
     [java] Central to this is , of course , the realisation that most cases of food poisoning result from carelessness by food handlers -- hence the emphasis now on training .
     [java] 
     [java] But the scant dynamical evidence requiring the existence of this planet is largely refuted in a new analysis by Myles Standish of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
     [java] 
     [java] The study of bureaucracy has formed part of the analysis by economists of public choice in the non-market sector .
     [java] 
     [java] That is an analysis by the officers of what additional funds they felt was needed for them to fulfil their statutory duties .
     [java] 
     [java] The individual course , and the student experience on that course , can not constitute a `` secret garden '' , but must be open for critical examination by the staff acting together as a corporate body .
     [java] 
     [java] 1.21 The plaintiff 's rights in relation to medical examinations by the defendant 's doctor have been redefined in two cases .
     [java] 
     [java] Examination by a disposal team established that the contents were capable of causing damage or injury .
     [java] 
     [java] Some local activities , notably education , police and the fire service , are subject to inspection by government-appointed inspectors .
     [java] 
     [java] Any formalised structures should be reduced into written form and be available for inspection by all interested persons , employed staff as well as partners .
     [java] 
     [java] Confirmation of the official safety review came after a n investigation by Channel Four television into the deaths of patients .
     [java] 
     [java] An investigation by the Building Research Establishment a few years ago identified over a thousand different kinds of faults in new homes under construction .
     [java] 
     [java] It all began in the summer of 1990 , when investigations by various groups , including the International Primate Protection League , led to the confiscation , of the orangs at a port in Taiwan .
     [java] 
     [java] Preliminary investigations by Netherlands aviation officials indicated that the disaster , the worst ever in the Netherlands , was probably caused by aircraft metal fatigue stemming from excessive stress and corrosion .
     [java] 
     [java] An investigation by a Commission taskforce into the implications of the single market also concluded that existing systems are inadequate to ensure the protection of the environment .
     [java] 
     [java] Unfortunately the detailed work on which that revision is itself based has only been published in Soviet journals in Russian , so has not stood the test of scrutiny by Western astronomers .
     [java] 
     [java] Each process had to undergo careful scrutiny by the Environmental Health Department , and the cooks had to pass medical tests .
     [java] 
     [java] All company resolutions are subject to scrutiny by the court .
     [java] 
     [java] The Conservatives seemed rather more favourable to the prospect of scrutiny by backbench committees , perhaps because they felt that such a challenge would help to restrain public expenditure .
     [java] 
     [java] The accounts of local authorities are subject to scrutiny by auditors appointed by the Audit Commission .
     [java] 
     [java] They have demonstrated publicly , through close scrutiny by their peers , that they know what they are talking about .
     [java] 
     [java] It would require them to conform to stricter accounting and electoral procedures , and suggests scrutiny by the National Audit Office .
     [java] 
     [java] The tentative search by the Wordsworths for a Somerset home brought the unexpected discovery , probably made by Tom Poole , that Alfoxden was both empty and available .
     [java] 
     [java] It is a manifestation of the search by the ruling class for a solution to the problem of under-consumption .
     [java] 
     [java] This is not surprising , since it was derived from a study of past searches by users of the same library .
     [java] 
     [java] TELEVISION footage of a youth soccer match at Wembley 18 years ago has prompted a search by a former Merseyside non-league player for a permanent record of the game .
     [java] 
     [java] A study by the OECD tries to forecast what all these extra grey heads mean for public spending in different countries over the next 40 years , assuming that government policies remain unchanged .
     [java] 
     [java] A recent study by the North London Polytechnic shows that about 27 per cent of men have been victims of some unwanted sexual contact before they are 18 , compared to over 50 per cent for women .
     [java] 
     [java] A follow-up study by Jim Ogg , based at the Royal London Hospital , is expected to reveal links between carers who abuse and levels of stress they are under .
     [java] 
     [java] A series of studies by the research group have examined quantitative developments in capital investment , industrial production , trade and agriculture .
     [java] 
     [java] A recent survey by the British Institute of Management showed that directors of larger companies had an average pay rise of 22.7% in 1990 .

     [java] A recent survey by the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association showed a 60 per cent increase in biotechnology medicines under development in the US over the past four years .
     [java] 
     [java] The survey by the Brussels Commission found 28 per cent of people in the UK want the EC scrapped .
     [java] 
     [java] A survey by the environmental group Friends of the Earth has revealed that air quality in four British towns is breaching safety levels set by the EC .
     [java] 
     [java] But it also coincided yesterday with a pledge by Mr Egon Krenz , the party leader , that there `` can not and will not be an East Germany without a Communist Party . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The new agreement was made possible after a pledge by industrialized countries of an extra US$500,000,000 , on top of US$240,000,000 already committed , to help developing countries adapt in 1994-96 .
     [java] 
     [java] The decision problem which confronted policy makers was given formal expression by Lipsey ( 1962 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] It was then that the four members of the Sex Pistols were taken , well-lubricated , from the hospitality suite of Thames Television to face interrogation by Bill Grundy on the popular teatime magazine programme , Today .
     [java] 
     [java] Part of the mutual learning process is that you may find that apparently sensible objectives need altering in the light of critical questioning by alert subordinates .
     [java] 
     [java] Appeals by the government urging exiled opposition leaders , in particular Alpha Conde of the RPG , to return to Guinea to participate in the political liberalization were largely ignored .
     [java] 
     [java] The bodies were exhumed on the orders of a judge , who had disregarded the opposition of representatives of known right-wing paramilitary groups while hearing an appeal by human rights groups .
     [java] 
     [java] Fears of violence both before and after the election led to an appeal by Chiluba on Oct. 18 to the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) to send peacekeeping forces to Zambia .
     [java] 
     [java] An appeal by the Chairman to chambers for extra pupillage places was undertaken during May after a questionnaire had been completed by all students of the Inns of Court School of Law regarding their pupillage position .
     [java] 
     [java] Again the prosecution must rely on what the driver tells them or on written instructions and, in rare cases, on admissions by the employer .
     [java] 
     [java] The observations of a witness or an admission by the accused would prove this point.
     [java] 
     [java] In such cases the witness can try to identify the voice, but the best evidence is an admission by the offender that he was the caller .
     [java] 
     [java] The SADF statement contradicted an earlier admission by President F.W. de Klerk that the SADF had trained 150 Inkatha members in 1986 in '' VIP protection '' .
     [java] 
     [java] The ecologists ' leader Brice Lalonde, who has called for a broad-based ``Democratic Party '', welcomed Mr Rocard's speech as the first admission by a top Socialist that the party was finished .

     [java] 
     [java] It alleges `` untrue and defamatory '' allegations by Mr Branson and Virgin .
     [java] 
     [java] His invention of photogenic drawing dated back four years earlier but he was spurred to bring it to the attention of the scientific world by the announcement by the Frenchman Daguerre of his revolutionary invention, the Daguerreotype .
     [java] 
     [java] I have already referred to the fact that the need to move the children had been precipitated by the announcement by the friends of the family with whom the children were staying that they could not keep the children any longer .
     [java] 
     [java] Institutional shareholders complain that all too many bad news announcements by companies are preceded by ``mysterious '' slides in their share prices.
     [java] 
     [java] The announcement by the government of liberalization measures to reactivate the economy was reported on Oct. 21; these included exchange rate adjustments to favour exports, lifting credit restrictions, reducing bank controls and opening credit lines to promote production.
     [java] 
     [java] On arms control issues, an announcement by the Soviet side that it would stop producing rail-mounted strategic nuclear missiles from the beginning of 1991 was the one concrete outcome of the talks.
     [java] 
     [java] In July an announcement by the Turkish authorities of their intention to settle the deserted Greek town of Varossi (in the Turkish-occupied zone) heightened tension, as did the decision to settle ethnic Turkish Moslem refugees from Bulgaria in other Turkish-occupied towns.
     [java] 
     [java] By contrast , here is a comment by an anthropologist who went to see the work of Mark Rothko .
     [java] 
     [java] However , comments by the American Banker 's President that U S industry must shed more jobs , saw Wall Street lose thirty four points .
     [java] 
     [java] William Emser has resurrected for us a brilliantly stupid comment by the eighteenth century classical scholar Bentley on these lines .
     [java] 
     [java] I have not seen that comment by doctors , but I assure the right hon. Gentleman that that is not the situation .
     [java] 
     [java] Engineers at British Steel have reacted warily to comments by Ian MacGregor , the corporation 's chairman , about the possibility of bringing out of mothballs two direct-reduction ironmaking plants in Scotland .
     [java] 
     [java] The lack of continuity and progression for many pupils has been a subject of regular critical comments by inspectors in their evaluations of schools .
     [java] 
     [java] They therefore encouraged correspondingly narrow-based teaching which had attracted adverse comments by Her Majesty 's Inspectorate ( HMI ) in the National Secondary Survey .
     [java] 
     [java] This echoed earlier comments by Mandela that the first non-racial government would be a coalition .
     [java] 
     [java] It is perhaps significant that the first reported comment by a United States court on the Convention concerned this very area .
     [java] 
     [java] The European Commission brought the charges following a complaint by Friends of the Earth .
     [java] 
     [java] As a result of that incident there were a number of complaints by members of the public about the conduct of some of the police officers who had attended the incident .
     [java] 
     [java] In spite of complaints by leaders of trade unions many of their members bought up the shares .
     [java] 
     [java] Edward still prevaricated , but at the Parliament of March 1299 the magnates extorted further concessions by the threat of armed force .
     [java] 
     [java] The assistant recorder held that he had been so committed notwithstanding ( so it is said ) an express concession by the prosecution that he had not .
     [java] 
     [java] Concessions by the government on the release of political prisoners and the return of exiles were also announced [ see p. 37642 ] .
     [java] 
     [java] I am not convinced , despite contentions by some , that even with increased resourcing this positive provision could be recreated for many children in their home and community settings .
     [java] 
     [java] Some researchers have disputed the contention by others that maternal age itself is responsible through its biologic effects for differential conditions of child health and mortality .
     [java] 
     [java] A joint declaration by opposition groups and government parties issued after the country 's first round-table talks said that free elections should be held by next May 6 at the latest .

     [java] She describes as a calamity the declaration by the Director of Public Prosecutions that there is `` insufficient evidence '' to initiate proceedings against Juliette by the Marquis de Sade .
     [java] 
     [java] The plenum was also the occasion for the central committee to make its final assessment of the December 1989 independence declaration by the Lithuanian Communist Party [ see pp. 37128-29 ; 37168 ] .
     [java] 
     [java] For some reason , William sought to get rid of Adelizia and he began a case against her in the church courts which ended in a declaration by Pope Innocent II that his first contractual marriage was binding .
     [java] 
     [java] Egypt 's independence had been a unilateral declaration by Britain ; and the reservations imposed were to become a running sore in the relations between the two countries .
     [java] 
     [java] Official denials by the Argentine Foreign Office were interpreted as playing for time to avoid loss of face .
     [java] 
     [java] Moreover , on Feb. 17 the Moscow media reports were retracted on the basis of a denial by officials in Samarkand that any unrest had taken place .
     [java] 
     [java] The alleged remarks by doctors to patients quoted above were taken from an Action Campaign survey highlighting `` bad '' treatment .

     [java] He regards a recent remark by the Labour leader of Stirling district council that he `` interferes more in local issues than any other MP in Scotland '' as a tribute .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Clinton 's problems were compounded by fresh questions about his Vietnam War draft status , and controversy over remarks by his outspoken wife , Hillary .
     [java] 
     [java] His comments mirror similar remarks by other scientists , who have warned that excessive reactions against pesticide traces in drinking water could cause serious difficulties for the water industry .
     [java] 
     [java] A FULL inquiry has begun into remarks by a senior Strathclyde Region official that the high numbers of black and Asian children in special schools could be due to genetic or nutritional factors .

     [java] '' The forthright revelation by Magic Johnson that he is infected with HIV '' was welcomed on Nov. 11 by the director of WHO 's global programme on AIDS , Michael H. Merson .
     [java] 
     [java] This is reflected in the rule that statements by the accused to be admissible must have been made voluntarily.
     [java] 
     [java] It is not difficult to understand why this short statement by Winston Churchill changed history.
     [java] 
     [java] We will increase the availability both of treatment by women health professionals and of home birth .
     [java] 
     [java] If there is any infestation at all , you can be certain that there is more undetected , and that treatment by a specialist firm will be essential .
     [java] 
     [java] The Community Dental Service is required to provide clinical dental care for those patients refused dental treatment by a general dental practitioner .

     [java] The organisers suggest using Thruxton or Old Sarum if you plan to arrive by air , but no transport has been arranged to the show .
     [java] 
     [java] Traffic congestion is not yet a major worry around the area , but in very popular spots , such as the Lake District 90% of the visitors arrive by car .
     [java] 
     [java] However , most people now come by road .
     [java] 
     [java] By 1914 , however , the situation was totally transformed : 96 per cent of London 's milk came by train .
     [java] 
     [java] And a man from the Co-op in Croft would cycle over each week to take orders , the goods coming later by van .
     [java] 
     [java] They came by road , they came by water , and the arrival of the railway much later added to Rorschach 's significance .
     [java] 
     [java] We entered the upper room by a flight of stairs leading from the north side of the yard .
     [java] 
     [java] As I entered the big house by the back door I noticed a lot of activity , people dashing here and there .
     [java] 
     [java] Last time the fibre-optic and wire-cutter had gone in by the front door ; this time they were to enter by the back .
     [java] 
     [java] Meanwhile Rachel had taken a taxi to the museum ; she had entered by the back door and exchanged a smile with the doorkeeper .
     [java] 
     [java] George dragged her upright by her hair .
     [java] 
     [java] `` At the last moment she tried to back out but I dragged her back by the elbow .
     [java] 
     [java] Eventually he pulled her off and dragged her away by the scruff of her neck .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Clausewitz , distantly pursued by Mr Pick , thought war was always subordinate to political will .
     [java] 
     [java] The logistics of his complicated destiny involved not only Skunk Kilo , anchored by its FBI crew in international waters , but the USS Butte , a Navy ammunitions ship that had been shadowing the yacht by radar , the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga , standing by with a Navy S-3 jet and an escort of two F-14 Phantoms to fly him to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington , D.C. , two KC-10 tanker aircraft to refuel the S-3 on the way , and 15 carloads of FBI agents to meet him on arrival .

     [java] 
     [java] Even this defection by Rothermere was not allowed to pass without a characteristic explanation from Joyce himself :

     [java] The tour departs Glasgow by SAS flight on Sunday 13 June , returning on Saturday 19 June .
     [java] 
     [java] After lunch depart by boat for a five-hour journey down the Kok river , passing tiny hilltribe villages , bamboo huts and jungle .

     [java] 
     [java] Rumour has it that he has taken up residence in the port of Leith , near enough to Edinburgh but , should matters go wrong , the best place for his departure by land or sea .
     [java]

     [java] You can , of course , define Pacifism by a reference to force , but you can not thereby save the world from the use of force .
     [java] 
     [java] But as with black women psychologists , feminist psychology defines lesbian psychologists almost entirely by their difference .
     [java] 
     [java] She defines your status by what you do .
     [java] 
     [java] Yet for most of human history people have defined themselves by work .
     [java] 
     [java] All four books about Ayesha , defined by courtesy and by their subject-matter as adventure stones , contain in fact relatively little action .
     [java] 
     [java] It also changes over historical time , in different geographical regions , and in different social groups , defined by ethnicity , class , gender , occupation and so on .
     [java] 
     [java] What constituted a `` pagan '' was a matter of definition by clerical authority ; in practice it meant what evaded the bishop 's control .

     [java] It ca n't have pleased the sponsors and the whole affair overshadowed an excellent win by St Helens -- who are going to push Wigan all the way this season .
     [java] 
     [java] --MEMBERS and staff of the Riverside Club in Durham recently celebrated another win by their restaurant manager Michael Hopper the North-East Counties Boxing Champion .

     [java] 
     [java] But how does one differentiate between a block and a bomb ?
     [java] 
     [java] Hahnemann 's writings clearly show that he differentiates between the level of potency and smallness of the dose i.e. the quantity given .
     [java] 
     [java] It is useful to discriminate between a capacity which is a natural endowment and an ability which is a competence to act .
     [java] 
     [java] It is not possible to discriminate between the components of each category .
     [java] 
     [java] Our hospitals would be empty if we tried to discriminate between self-induced or even partially self-induced illnesses , and naturally developed diseases .
     [java] 
     [java] Rhesus monkeys readily discriminate between objects and scenes on the basis of their visual appearance .

     [java] Rats were tested on a food-rewarded ( conditional go left/go right ) discrimination between tone and clicker .
     [java] 
     [java] Phonemes are obviously sensitive enough to make fine discriminations between lexical descriptions since this is their function by definition .
     [java] 
     [java] When you are teaching children to distinguish between right and wrong and between obedient and disobedient behaviour , you need to be predictable in your reactions .
     [java] 
     [java] Since it is accepted that the consensus varies according to time and place , it is not clear how one distinguishes between a legitimate consensus and a deviant subculture .
     [java] 
     [java] Should the criminal law really distinguish between unmarried and married couples when it comes to dealing with rape ?
     [java] 
     [java] In order to create this relationship of mutual esteem between yourself and your examiner , pay him the compliment of searching for the point of his problem .

     [java] If Anna 's not with the navvies I 'll try to get some of their men to search between your camp and the new road . ''
     [java] 
     [java] They even searched between the sheets and under the mattresses , and gave no answer when she asked what they were looking for .
     [java] 
     [java] Both Mead and Vygotsky proposed that communication between the child and older children or adults provides the essential conditions for emergence of `` media '' , whereby a word or gesture can stand for an aspect of experience .
     [java] 
     [java] The only communication between him and his family had been letters smuggled out .
     [java] 
     [java] Although Margo concluded that general practitioners were generally satisfied with the initial outpatient letter , most studies have found that communication between the hospital specialist and the general practitioner could be better .
     [java] 
     [java] After many conversations , it is my feeling that we need better communication between the youth of Shropshire and the youth of the rest of the diocese .
     [java] 
     [java] Most of our communication between one another is indirect ; we conceal our motives .
     [java] 
     [java] The major obstacle to the development of radical national ideas in the six counties is the lack of any form of communication between the Movement and the people .
     [java] 
     [java] And the previous level of frankness in communication between the spouses about these matters can narrow or widen the possibility of stress between them during these communications in a hospital ward .
     [java] 
     [java] The telephone as an instrument of communication between people is being used more and more .
     [java] 
     [java] This is characterised by one-way communication between the manager and the subordinate , with the manager telling the subordinate what to do .
     [java] 
     [java] More company accountants are aware that the City needs better information on R -- which augurs well for an improved dialogue between industry and the City
     [java] 
     [java] There seems the possibility of a regular dialogue between umpires and batsmen as the batsmen seek confirmation as to whether they have played a shot , or on the likely height of the next delivery .
     [java] 
     [java] But if these kinds of books are discarded the dialogue between the generations vanishes .
     [java] 
     [java] Externally , the Community stands in the forefront of the changing relations between East and West , and the North-South dialogue between the world 's advanced industrial states and the developing countries .
     [java] 
     [java] Yet it also represented at least a first step towards an institutional framework for dialogue between State and commoners .

     [java] 
     [java] Where Mr Winchester 's cross-Pacific connections become less sure is when they become tangible and man-made : the optical-fibre telephone cable that snakes beneath the Pacific from California to Hawaii and then branches out to Japan and Guam ; the AsiaSat satellite and its fellow `` birds '' , sitting on the equator to bounce across Asia the telephone calls of businessmen and the television dramas of Hollywood ; the new Boeing 747-400 , able to fly non-stop from Sydney to Los Angeles ; and , odd as it seems , the Macintosh computer .

     [java] While his retainers squatted noiselessly behind him , the Tominah advanced to the edge of a rock overlooking the pool by about six feet , closed his eyes and opened his betel-nut-rouged mouth .
     [java] 
     [java] One helper ( the tallest ) should squat behind the person and raise their shoulders slightly .

     [java] She came through the front door of the shop and was a little surprised at not seeing her husband behind the counter .
     [java] 
     [java] Through the window he could see over grey slate roofs across the bay to Newlyn , a mound of little houses behind its quays and boats and sheds .
     [java] 
     [java] Then a distorted voice began speaking , his silhouette vaguely seen behind the milky glass .

     [java] 
     [java] Throughout their journey they had felt little of the uneasy fear that smells danger behind every bush but despite the weariness that dulled their senses these half-seen forms of rock among the trees seemed now to imply a threatening human presence .
     [java] 
     [java] As they left the confines of the city and started on the long straight empty road to Samana , the sun was glowing ruby-red behind the dark wooded hills , the sky translucent delicate silk .

     [java] 
     [java] He made a move towards her and bawled at her to `` get out '' , which she did but not without slamming the door for all she was worth behind her .
     [java] 
     [java] Doctor Rice would n't have chatted with her like he was doing ; he would have bawled at her and said , `` I 'll see him .
     [java] 
     [java] And many were the times when she had wanted to bawl at him , `` And who was to blame for that ?
     [java] 
     [java] `` If it had taken place in London or New York I would have simply bawled at him to get lost .

     [java] 
     [java] A look of relief passed over his own face when , the dreadful malaise gone , she croaked at him , `` Oh , dear , what happened ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] When he drew on his leather gloves as if preparing for some task ahead , `` Stop , '' she cried at him .
     [java] 
     [java] She had taken to growling menacingly at the more impressionable of the remedials to keep herself occupied .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Get on with you then , do your laughing somewhere else , '' he growled at them .
     [java] 
     [java] Put it back yourself if you like it round here , '' he growled at Threlfall , and pushed the teacher up the steps .
     [java] 
     [java] She hissed at Ariel to make him leave , and Ariel would wave him to keep his distance ; Jack did not mind .
     [java] 
     [java] Lily hissed at Charlie and darted to the prompt corner .
     [java] 
     [java] And they used to moan at each other : `` Your system sounds different from my system
     [java] 
     [java] If he did n't turn up they moaned at him later for not being there , and they had used his name for fund-raising without permission .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Ray 's always moaning at me to get in the box .

     [java] 
     [java] He was screaming at her from down in the channel .
     [java] 
     [java] He screamed at me and I screamed back .
     [java] 
     [java] He can turn his head away from the screams , the pleas , the heart-rending shouts that split the night air -- suffering human beings screeching their injustice at the outside world .
     [java] 
     [java] She suddenly started screeching at Bruno , so abruptly that Maxim felt a jab in his spine and knew he 'd come very close to being shot .
     [java] 
     [java] I suddenly screeched at her , `` I do n't want to know ! '' and threw down the phone and pushed myself out of the door .

     [java] 
     [java] `` You killed Sabine , '' she shrieked at Joseph .
     [java] 
     [java] Do you have to ? '' she snarled at him as he took out a cigarette .

     [java] `` The Smiths are here ! '' she squawked at him .
     [java] 
     [java] Father Peter thundered at the multitude , `` Shall ye speak of sin and not know the wrath of God ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Before she could speak , however , Jessie whimpered at her , `` I 'm sorry .
     [java] 
     [java] The driver yelled something at her as he passed , and the bystanders regarded her disapprovingly .
     [java] 
     [java] She all but yelled the words at him , incensed beyond reason that he could even consider such a thing .
     [java] 
     [java] Charles was too concerned with Jacqui even to yell the usual obscenities at the Swede .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Where are you taking that bag ? '' she yelled at him .
     [java] 
     [java] Then she yelled at nobody in particular , `` Who 's doing this ?
     [java] 
     [java] And if the meat was not quite to perfection he used to grumble at my grandmother

     [java] 
     [java] In some remarks at the National Press Club in December , Mr Keating gave credence to this speculation by saying , in effect , that he would make a better prime minister than Mr Hawke .
     [java] 
     [java] Understandably , she fretted at this circumscribed lifestyle , but another episode of somewhat more serious bleeding two weeks ago had convinced everyone that the programme of rest and professional care was not an overcautious one .
     [java] 
     [java] Still , it 's natural for the novelist sometimes to fret at the obliquities of fiction .

     [java] 
     [java] They 'll be annoyed at the College too , '' Sarah said .
     [java] 
     [java] He sounded annoyed at himself for letting that slip and Ages wondered how much was genuine : the codename the slip the annoyance .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We have waited 22 months for justice to be done and are appalled at the verdict , '' it read .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm sorry , '' she said , appalled at what she 'd done .
     [java] 
     [java] He stopped , appalled at himself .
     [java] 
     [java] She was cross at the way he had treated her as though she were n't a normal girl -- some kind of freak .
     [java] 
     [java] If he overheard anything , it was simply the reaction of grown men disappointed at the delay . ''

     [java] `` You 've got every right to be mad at me , Mike .
     [java] 
     [java] And I 'm mad at you , you 've no ambition .
     [java] 
     [java] She was still mad at Lucy for something , and Lucy was sure that a little time and concentration would tell her what but for the moment , somehow , the knowledge was just out of reach .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I thought perhaps you were still mad at me . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` Because she still sounded mad at me , and I thought you might try to dissuade me .
     [java] 
     [java] I could never have agreed to such a plan , but was pleased at Mick 's change of mood .

     [java] Akram said : `` We are all tired and upset at the accusations .

     [java] Sometimes I despair at the innumeracy of the left .
     [java] 
     [java] Most people are keen for their children to be educated but despair at the kind of education they receive .
     [java] 
     [java] She boiled at his lack of thought for her and replied , louder than she had intended that indeed he had , that , unlike last year , there was a choice .
     [java] 
     [java] Corbett felt his own anger boil at the Prioress ' air of righteous indignation .
     [java] 
     [java] He wanted above all to know that he still lay safe and quiet in his nameless grave ; he was heavy and burning at heart with his longing to ask , but he would not .
     [java] 
     [java] Coleridge , still lame , chafed at his own confinement , especially when his friends set off one evening towards the hills , leaving him useless and lonely in Tom Poole 's garden arbour .

     [java] 
     [java] As soon as she arrived at the office , she went to see Mr Tranter , the editor .
     [java]

     [java] Blake took a last look at Victorian London .
     [java]

     [java] And on this morning , of all mornings , James phoned at the crack of dawn and asked me to preside over a ridiculous Press party .
     [java] 
     [java] So I gave myself just half an hour to get to the theatre and prepare for curtain up -- and phoned home at each interval .

     [java] 
     [java] I 've been ringing my family at regular intervals to see how things are going . ''
     [java] 
     [java] But he rang at 10.30 , hung over and apologetic .

     [java] 
     [java] So it was duly arranged , and Uncle William and Aunt Sarah took their little niece for baptism at their recently-rebuilt Zion Chapel in Frome in 1817 , just across the road from the Badcox Lane Baptists .

     [java] 
     [java] The tradition at Alnwick Castle , Northumberland , dates back years .

     [java] 
     [java] They stood smoking at the end of the passage and watched Auriega .

     [java] That night I woke at half-past three and lay brooding over my lack of progress .
     [java] 
     [java] One Christmas Eve I woke at the critical moment , and saw , not Santa Claus , but three familiar figures indulging in heavy horse play at the foot of the bed .
     [java] 
     [java] But she would have woken at the sound of an engine .
     [java] 
     [java] Constance was deeply embarrassed at the intimate turn the conversation had taken .

     [java] 
     [java] They 're not building that runway at Potosi so that we Bolivians can travel , as if we had the money !

     [java] 
     [java] Even in the 1930s the anti-Semitism of literary figures like Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton co-existed uneasily with their revulsion at the racial policies of the new Germany .
     [java] 
     [java] Thomas Coram 's revulsion at the infant corpses in London gutters led him to campaign for a hospital for foundlings , established in 1741 .
     [java] 
     [java] Revulsion at injustice , poverty and denied opportunity , he says , impels people to work for a better world .

     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] There is indeed much disquiet at any delay in immediate fulfilment .
     [java] 
     [java] Martha replied , and left her twin sister blinking in astonishment at a possibility that had n't occurred to her before , but which was now enticingly attractive .

     [java] 
     [java] As well as prophesying the triumph of `` the Saints '' and the destruction of their enemies , Anna also declared God 's displeasure at Oliver Cromwell 's being made lord protector on 16 December 1653 .

     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] But the subtext of Lupus 's letter was disappointment at Charles 's withholding of St-Josse , and so the veiled reference here was evidently to Odulf .
     [java] 
     [java] The rector felt a little inner agitation at this news , but did his best to look disappointed at Ella 's temporary absence .

     [java] The train crawled slowly along until , eventually , our destination came in sight .
     [java] 
     [java] THE jeep crawled along Argyle Street and turned right into Union Street by the all-night `` Boots '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Huge jams built up behind the 74-year-old pensioner as he crawled for five miles along the inside lane of the dual-carriageway A1 .
     [java] 
     [java] I dressed and crept along the endless corridors until I found the staircase and slid silently down the banisters under the disapproving eye of Sir Mauger Grindlewood .
     [java] 
     [java] She would pretend to be frightened when he jumped out , would call out to him to be careful when he crept along an overhanging branch and hung , skimming the water .
     [java] 
     [java] He crept along the wall , keeping in the shadows .
     [java] 
     [java] Piper O'Rourke used her hand to shield the beam of her torch as she crept along the darkened corridors of Belial Base towards the main airlock .
     [java] 
     [java] As they crept along they could not help wondering what they would find .
     [java] 
     [java] Staying close to the wooden wall , he crept along between the shed and the hedge .
     [java] 
     [java] No sound came from the garden , so she crept along to the gate and squeezed herself under .
     [java] 
     [java] She turned her back on the squabbling creatures and crept off along the footpath .
     [java] 
     [java] The Doctor 's subconscious danced happily along the ethereal plane that carries telepathic communication .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Disco gear ; we have the most fantastic make-up and we dance along the catwalk to the most way-out music , which Roman has had specially composed . ''
     [java] 
     [java] A tremor danced along her skin .
     [java] 
     [java] Ginny waited for a bus and watched people darting along the pavements and in and out of shops .
     [java] 
     [java] Sweating with fear , Lepine dashed along the verandah and flung himself behind the wheel of the Citron .
     [java] 
     [java] Peach dashed excitedly along to the nursery , flinging aside the stuffed animals , her teddy , the Raggedy Ann doll and the friendly little dog on wheels , desperately trying to find it .
     [java] 
     [java] In Cornwall , south-western England , it is said that a giant white hare named Looe gambols along the clifftops on evenings when there is a full moon .
     [java] 
     [java] She went for long solitary hikes along well-marked trails .
     [java] 
     [java] We arrive exhausted , haul in our rucsacs , check in again and hike back along the corridor to the airport .
     [java] 
     [java] The sergeant hobbled along the red carpet in his flip-flops and paused alongside a line of footpaths containing a bright purple solution and cubes of ice .
     [java] 
     [java] The old lady hobbled along the line again , pausing almost for half a minute each in front of a besuited man and the slovenly individual with the studded ear .
     [java] 
     [java] Come this way ! '' he seemed to say , as he hopped along the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] Then there is an old man who I think has St. Vitus 's dance --his body is twisted around a long pole he carries and he hops along twitching and jigging like a puppet .
     [java] 
     [java] Nursery owner Paul Hutchinson has been able to keep track of Wally 's progress through reports to police from startled motorists who spotted him hopping along roads in the area .
     [java] 
     [java] It also gives the animal unusually short front legs and long hind legs , and an abnormally small anus , so that it hops along like a rabbit and suffers from constipation .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Then I suggest you hop along to the end of the garden , '' Sergeant told them .
     [java] 
     [java] As he hopped along beside her , she hopped and sang too , to show him that she was his friend .
     [java] 
     [java] He paused on the footpath , and barked , urging the animals to hurry along .
     [java] 
     [java] He hurried along the deserted early-morning pavements to the cinema .
     [java] 
     [java] Hurry along to your Proton dealer today -- the prize draw takes place at the end of February !
     [java] 
     [java] `` The whole point of this afternoon was to advertise my company , not to go for a jaunt along the river . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He pulled on his shoes , rose and began to jog along the road in the direction the car had taken .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The other 's jogging along all right .
     [java] 
     [java] She was walking so fast now , circling the camp , that he had to jog along to keep up .
     [java] 
     [java] We imagined ourselves in a cosy little country practice , jogging along comfortably and enjoying our work .
     [java] 
     [java] It took an hour or more to jog along from Canonbury to Paddington , but we did reach the enchanted spot at last .
     [java] 
     [java] Breathing deeply and evenly , he jogged steadily along through the rustling darkness of the forest , enjoying the exertion and allowing the exercise to wash away the pressures of the past night .
     [java] 
     [java] She pressed her foot down and the car leapt forwards along the road .
     [java] 
     [java] How could Mr. Waddicar be limping doggedly along the corridor when she could see him outside in the yard ?
     [java] 
     [java] The village church without either organist or choir may limp along with three half-hearted hymns and two fingers on a harmonium .
     [java] 
     [java] Paul Ashmead was sent off while number eight Bobby Fowke limped along with an injury
     [java] 
     [java] In the US , where the government is the only major backer , research has limped along at about half a million dollars a year .
     [java] 
     [java] The rambling voice got lost in a maze of tenses as Twoflower ran along the dead tunnels , with the dragon loping along easily behind him .
     [java] 
     [java] It was extremely difficult to know what to do with a giant who loped along at your side and who could reach out and pluck you from your horse 's back with one hand .
     [java] 
     [java] As the four-man squad loped , half-crouching , along the space station 's strangely-twisting corridors , Ace and Daak were squabbling about which of them should guard the other 's back .
     [java] 
     [java] Three were gross , misshapen versions of the human form , lumbering along at a slow , uneven pace , one leading a small trolley containing a dark , oblong box that had several strange attachments to it .
     [java] 
     [java] We travelled there by train ; I remember herds of blackbuck grazing near the line and bullock-carts lumbering along in clouds of dust .
     [java] 
     [java] When you find one of these giants embedded in the honey-coloured limestones of central England or the hard blue rocks of Dorset , you might think that such immense creatures could do little but lumber massively along the sea bed .
     [java] 
     [java] Later that evening -- many glasses later , and four or five hours -- he took a bus to his old house and lurched gaily along the interminable suburban road .
     [java] 
     [java] As dusk fell they reached the lower slopes and shortly afterwards found themselves lurching along the bottom of a small boulder-strewn ravine .
     [java] 
     [java] The driver did n't have to point out the bullet-riddled windows of the coach as we lurched along from Bucharest airport to Poiana Brasov .
     [java] 
     [java] This further provoked the students , who resumed their march along Changan Avenue , halting the early morning traffic and disrupting the centre of Beijing .
     [java] 
     [java] Through it the legions of Claudius and Nero had set off on their march along Watling Street nearly two thousand years ago .
     [java] 
     [java] About 200 joined the march along the Mile End Road .
     [java] 
     [java] Duregar , a kinsman of Belegar from Karaz a Karak , immediately gathered an army and marched southwards along the western flanks of the mountains .
     [java] 
     [java] The Grand Army had been marching along the west bank of the Goldbach , parallel to enemy , and away from its base in the Austrian capital .
     [java] 
     [java] We would march along in step , doing eighty-eight paces to the minute , singing our hearts out .
     [java] 
     [java] She stood up and began pacing restlessly to and fro along the balcony .
     [java] 
     [java] Hencke hurried on ahead , taking the opposite route around the square and relieved to see the other man pacing along his accustomed route , his briefcase tucked under his left arm .
     [java] 
     [java] Albert Camus watched young men and women stroll here in the style of Hollywood stars , but now it is a place where people pace quickly along , not to display themselves but simply to get somewhere else .
     [java] 
     [java] I saw him to the door and watched him pace away along the streets he knew better than most others in London .
     [java] 
     [java] On the right and the left of my track , padding along in parallel silence were bears .
     [java] 
     [java] Rain spitting in my face , I plodded along the narrow coastal road , through scenery eerie and desolate , unseen spirits everywhere , conjured up by Michael Quirke .
     [java] 
     [java] The latter impression is largely due to the work of the tuba player , Bob Stewart , who plods along throughout in a delightfully flatulent way .
     [java] 
     [java] But we wan na stay where we are , 'cos it allows us to put records out , it allows us to plod along , which is the important thing for us at the moment .
     [java] 
     [java] Later , I thought wearily , as my tired horse plodded along the shore of the Lake , I would see more clearly what to do .
     [java] 
     [java] Every morning Graham left for school in his dad 's new Ford Granada , sweeping past Henry and the Hodgkinsons as they plodded along to the bus stop .
     [java] 
     [java] We plod along for two or three decades with the occasional recording of individual sonatas and then along comes a centenary year and all and sundry are in on the act at the same time .
     [java] 
     [java] For shrews live as long as 1.5 years , while many elephants plod along for over 50 years .
     [java] 
     [java] As an independent soul you usually prefer to plod along in your own time .
     [java] 
     [java] The cows were approaching in a long , strung-out line , plodding purposefully along beneath clouds of steam rising from their muddy flanks .
     [java] 
     [java] I would stand at the street door and wait until his tall , burly figure appeared , still plodding along with that measured tread acquired from years on the beat .
     [java] 
     [java] Beside him , Dougal almost pranced along the pavement .
     [java] 
     [java] Young people mostly ; some were singing and prancing along in the middle of the roadway .
     [java] 
     [java] Yvonne and I at South Queensferry a couple of summers ago , across the road from the Hawes Inn at the slipway underneath the tall stone piers of the rail-bridge , the mile-wide river bright before us , people promenading along pavements and down the pier , an occasional smell of frying onions from the snack bar beside the Inshore Lifeboat shed .
     [java] 
     [java] Cadfael began to prowl uphill along the edge of the path , probing into the bushes , and then downhill again on the opposite side .
     [java] 
     [java] You have to be very careful when prowling along the shelves .
     [java] 
     [java] As a child she roamed freely along the country lanes , knew the wild flowers by name and smell and the birds in dialect .
     [java] 
     [java] She spent her nights romping along the canal in the moonlight .
     [java] 
     [java] The morning passed by in a flurry of activity , and she barely saw Dane , except for a fleeting moment as he rushed headlong along the corridor , pausing long enough to drop a kiss on her lips that turned her knees to water .
     [java] 
     [java] He rushed along London Street and Bridge Road so fast that he puffed and staggered the last few yards to the cottage where he lived with his parents and two younger brothers .
     [java] 
     [java] One of the men now rushed from the room and along a passage to some stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] We rushed along the corridor to a small private room with a bathroom en suite , and as the door slammed shut behind me a virtual volcanic eruption shook the other end of my torso
     [java] 
     [java] I sauntered along attractively named Wine Street , then came to a bridge over the rushing River Garavogue .
     [java] 
     [java] In this paradise , our man saunters along the road only to obstruct the rush of business .
     [java] 
     [java] Rather forbiddingly he saunters along the lower rink , past the clumps of families , the young mothers , the babies ' cries .
     [java] 
     [java] A young man in gum boots saunters along the road with a shotgun under his arm .
     [java] 
     [java] The sudden snap of Joseph 's history book closing caused the senator to glance up briefly but he did n't pause in his monologue ; his abstracted gaze followed the younger boy for only a moment as he sauntered away along the deck .
     [java] 
     [java] About fifty or sixty yards away on the right-band side of the road a mortar bomb burst in the hedgerow , followed a few seconds later by four German soldiers carrying automatic weapons jumping from the hedgerow and scampering along the road .
     [java] 
     [java] E.S.B. was dead tired and Dave Dick had accepted that he would not win , for Devon Loch was scooting along , increasing his lead and certain to land a famous and hugely popular victory .
     [java] 
     [java] Ben scooted along the rows of benches , Indiana Jones fleeing from hundreds -- no , thousands -- of screaming Arabs , ready to turn and whip swords from the hands of any who got too close , his imaginary bull-whip settled comfortably over his left shoulder and no weight at all .
     [java] 
     [java] Within seconds , I 'd rolled over the parapet , scrambled along the lead gutter to the hatch , drawn the bolt and entered -- all without giving my head time to jam the works .
     [java] 
     [java] Forster scrambled along to the telegraph and rang the order .
     [java] 
     [java] The workers , scurrying along the tracks through the undergrowth , are blind and sterile .
     [java] 
     [java] We scurried along the ditch , doubled over .
     [java] 
     [java] Dr Ali was scurrying along beside him and from time to time glaring down the line of boys .
     [java] 
     [java] Smoke from a row of barbecues mixes with the dust of perhaps 15,000 people shuffling along the wooden stalls to shop for meat , antibiotics , the latest fashions , even , it is said , used cars .
     [java] 
     [java] A man wearing a hat he 'd painted and twisted into an unrecognizable shape shuffled along the corridor , pointing upwards with a contorted grimace .
     [java] 
     [java] He watched her as she danced a few larky steps with her daughter , singing in an effortfully pure soprano while Maisie shuffled along trying to keep the sweets safe under her jumper .
     [java] 
     [java] Defries pointed to the winged creatures spiralling down towards them , and then to a contingent of androids shuffling along the girder .
     [java] 
     [java] I stay a few feet behind , watching the three of them shuffle along at a ten-month-old 's pace .
     [java] 
     [java] Stephanie watched him dance or shuffle , two steps forward , one back , almost sideways along the paved path .
     [java] 
     [java] But the Doctor had turned on his heel and was almost skipping along the right-hand corridor .
     [java] 
     [java] He felt rather shy and silly , when he came back to the table with Lalage , skipping along and grabbing for his hand as she went .
     [java] 
     [java] She clung to me , and then she ran away ; she dashed through the flowers in the long grass , she twirled around a tree and sent lizards scuttling , she skipped along a sandy path .
     [java] 
     [java] She grabs a hold of my arm and skips along beside me .
     [java] 
     [java] He was with her now skipping along beside her , holding her hand , laughing and chattering , smiling at her with those winsome green eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] He took Mr Hellyer 's hand and skipped happily along beside him .
     [java] 
     [java] Dot unrolled her piece of twine and began to skip slowly along the pavement over the coal-hole covers towards the basement .
     [java] 
     [java] The children skipped along with him for a few yards and he saw how beguiling their faces were , the large dark eyes , the straggle of thick black hair , the earnest looks of desperate innocence .
     [java] 
     [java] Their assumption that `` he knows what he has done wrong '' is based on the fact that Rover is slinking along the floor with its head and tail down looking for all the world like a naughty school boy who 's just broken the headmaster 's window .
     [java] 
     [java] While cats slink along the wall
     [java] 
     [java] The sea slithered along the hulls with the sound of tearing paper as the yacht heeled to the slope of the wave , wind spilling for a moment , slap of canvas .
     [java] 
     [java] Although its body was serpentine it moved , not by slithering along the ground , but by rearing the forward half of its body along in a coil .
     [java] 
     [java] His impatient reply made her hackles rise even as a tiny treacherous thrill slithered along her veins .
     [java] 
     [java] Ranulf felt the wet scaliness against his skin as if some dreadful snake was slithering along his arm .
     [java] 
     [java] The bikes will have spokeless disc wheels , with their flywheel effect , for the 60 kilometre sprint along the Loire valley to Blois , plus every other new development on bike technology .
     [java] 
     [java] Before I could do anything , two medics came sprinting along the path from the direction of the big house .
     [java] 
     [java] Meh'Lindi had quit a transit capsule , had ridden an elevator down and was sprinting effortlessly along empty north-bound mobile pavements .
     [java] 
     [java] I staggered along with the baby and the heavy bag , and , of course , Elaine was n't there .
     [java] 
     [java] He stamped heavily up the stone steps , through the door , along the stone-paved entrance hall .
     [java] 
     [java] They count their steps along the darkened streets ,
     [java] 
     [java] In a number of cases , grain was carried up the canal to the docks , was transhipped , and promptly retraced its steps along the canal to Saul Junction where it passed onto the Stroudwater Canal .
     [java] 
     [java] Visitors to Yordas Cave who have left their cars parked at or near Masongill must retrace their steps along the Turbary Road , a walk equally enjoyable when done in reverse .
     [java] 
     [java] For Reg , bookmaking was a mere step along the road to riches and power on the grand scale .
     [java] 
     [java] Retrace your steps along the road and cross over the main St. David 's -- Haverfordwest road .
     [java] 
     [java] Beside me , Eva , in her jeans and tennis shoes , stepped along lightly , trying to hum one of Charlie 's songs and keep up with my fast pace .
     [java] 
     [java] The gloomy glint of glazed eyes followed her , watching from the petrified forest of branched horn as she stepped silently along the drugget .
     [java] 
     [java] Lewis stomped away along the tide-line , kicking at the odd piece of driftwood and the occasional plastic bottle .
     [java] 
     [java] They straggled lamentably along the road , bent in two by the weight of their packs , streaming with water , and all this to go and become mashed to pulp in muddy trenches .
     [java] 
     [java] A triumphant smile lit his perspiring face as he strode along the corridor to the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] He strode along the pavement , which flickered like a storm as his eyelids trembled .
     [java] 
     [java] More than an hour later Bobbie arrived , also alone , striding along as purposefully as usual .
     [java] 
     [java] They passed the delicate white blossoms of wild cherry , Sheila striding along in angry resentment , Mona following in her shadow .
     [java] 
     [java] He strode on along the right-hand fork ; the sweat stood in beads on his neck and trickled about his ankles .
     [java] 
     [java] After a delicious meal with free wine , the choice is yours : a quiet drink in the bar , the late-night disco , cabaret style entertainment or a stroll along the beach beneath a starry sky .
     [java] 
     [java] If your evenings are made for relaxing then why not enjoy a drink and chat with friends at the bar , or take a moonlit stroll along the beach , or simply sit back and absorb the atmosphere ?
     [java] 
     [java] But many people would prefer to do just what I did , and take a stroll along the most beautiful scenic promenades .
     [java] 
     [java] Take a stroll along the beautiful Wye Valley line , see the fascinating railway exhibition or a craft display , stop for tea on Platform 2 and watch the world go by .
     [java] 
     [java] As they resumed their stroll along the beckside , he stole a sideways glance at her , wondering why he had paid no attention to her before .
     [java] 
     [java] I was also depressed by the sight of rich , elderly couples strolling along laden with jewellery , the man 's arm laid lightly round his spouse 's shoulder .
     [java] 
     [java] But I was n't exactly strolling along enjoying myself .
     [java] 
     [java] I think too of another courageous woman , fighting for Irish freedom , gunned down in Gibraltar by British terrorists with her two male comrades while strolling peacefully along .
     [java] 
     [java] He was clutching his attache case as usual and I could see he was strolling slowly along the path that runs the outer perimeter of the lawn , deeply absorbed in thought .
     [java] 
     [java] As we stroll on the high path along the edge of the fields , Dixie explains about the man .
     [java] 
     [java] And those in charge strutted along the lines and there was an anger at their faces that Holly had not seen before .
     [java] 
     [java] As Holly , tired to death , stumbled along the last long stretch , a backpacked figure appeared in the distance which looked like his own image coming to meet him .
     [java] 
     [java] As she stumbled along the path , she began to sob .
     [java] 
     [java] He knew roughly where he was , or he knew in theory , and he stumbled slowly along in a westerly direction , sometimes holding onto the trunk of a birch tree .
     [java] 
     [java] From the back window she saw him swaggering along the dock , a hand on his hip , throwing keys in the air with insouciant authority .
     [java] 
     [java] On a recent trip to Somerset , I became aware that no one was swimming along what is an impressive and beautiful stretch of coastline .
     [java] 
     [java] On August Bank Holiday he swam along the Severn river from Tewkesbury to Gloucester , some 10 miles , raising $450 for the Children 's Society .
     [java] 
     [java] However , when the fish swims along the magnetic field , no current flows .
     [java] 
     [java] As Anableps swims along , one pair of eyes scans the air for predators , while the other pair examines the water for food .
     [java] 
     [java] Then she swam along the bank until she came to the old pontoon .
     [java] 
     [java] Slowly , I began to swim along under the castle walls .
     [java] 
     [java] But a good spy is supposed to take risks , so after a while I tiptoed along the passage to Claire 's door and peeped in .
     [java] 
     [java] I tiptoed along the corridor and put my head gingerly round the semi-open door .
     [java] 
     [java] They tiptoed along corridors shining and antiseptic , peeped at him where he lay , inert , in his white bed .
     [java] 
     [java] Tiptoe along the lanes and peer over hedges .
     [java] 
     [java] He moved away from her and started the car , his dark eyes gleaming in a way that sent a delicious shudder tiptoeing along her spine .
     [java] 
     [java] Sure enough , after a while I caught sight of my quarry , little Mathilda , her chubby arms full of blankets , tiptoeing along without a care in the world .
     [java] 
     [java] He put it under his overcoat , gently closed the boot , and tiptoed away along the yellow pavement in search of a yellow garage .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Well then , if you can promise it 'll be alright at Mona 's , let's toddle along there . ''
     [java] 
     [java] His back was to her , he was toddling along purposefully in the same direction as her , across that bleak empty landscape .
     [java] 
     [java] Would you like me to totter along a white line ?
     [java] 
     [java] My reply to that is that the quiet passage of a canoe going with the current is less likely to disturb the otter than a walker tramping along the bank of the river .
     [java] 
     [java] As he and Du Camp tramped along , he would introduce his friend to the trees and the bushes with mock gravity : `` May I present the young phenomenon ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Then he followed the others , who had to cross to land and tramp along the Embankment .
     [java] 
     [java] The other two pondered over this morsel as they tramped along behind him .
     [java] 
     [java] She trod cautiously along the street .
     [java] 
     [java] Afterwards , we all trooped along the narrow path and inspected the flowers .
     [java] 
     [java] I saw him doing a side shuffle to the main entrance as we all trooped along here .
     [java] 
     [java] They have trooped along to the lobby room to glean information from the Prime Minister 's press Secretary , Mr Bernard Ingham .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Well met , Lord , '' he gasped as his group trooped out along the ramparts .
     [java] 
     [java] The waitress trotting along beside her had seemed unsettled by the other man 's eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] She trotted along to the kitchen , but when she reached it , she stopped and listened carefully before opening the door .
     [java] 
     [java] The militants trudged along the empty lanes unobserved except by the Chief Constable of the county and his forces .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] There was a sudden bang as he crashed against the Lift , and a scraping sensation as he began to roll along the surface .
     [java] 
     [java] I think we should now talk of heads rolling along the Potomac .
     [java] 
     [java] but it rolls along the gutter and it drops down through the grating of a drain .
     [java] 
     [java] Still speculating , Mungo headed along the landing to the bathroom .

     [java] He depressed the accelerator a trifle and the Rover leaped across the metalled interruption of the ancient trackway .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Michael would get into Rolls-Royces by leaping across the pavement and jumping in head first , '' recalled Reed .
     [java] 
     [java] She sizzled and singed , then the fire began to take a hold and flames leapt across her skin .
     [java] 
     [java] He limped across the pavement and clambered into his car .
     [java] 
     [java] He could hardly limp across the room and offer her a plastic spoon , especially as it had already been used .
     [java] 
     [java] He held his hand to his forehead and loped across the bar toward the beautiful girl in the corner .
     [java] 
     [java] Arrived at St Briac she had loped across the headland , tiring a bit from the feeling that her heart had dropped in her chest and , turning to lead , lodged across her solar plexus .
     [java] 
     [java] It stopped instead , and two humans in dark blue suits got out and started to lumber across the field .
     [java] 
     [java] Decked in tasselled yellow howdah cloths and ridden by straw-hatted Annamese mahouts perched straddle-legged behind their ears , a dozen elephants lumbered slowly across the flagstones and lined up before the open doors .
     [java] 
     [java] The dragon stood up , lumbered heavily across the meadow , and fluttered into the air .
     [java] 
     [java] The conversation died abruptly as Cranston lurched across the room .
     [java] 
     [java] There was plenty of room for sheer caprice : Paul I's order for an overland march across unmapped territory to wrest India from the British was only the most bizarre instance .
     [java] 
     [java] A long and weary march across the border to Northern Kenya .
     [java] 
     [java] The orbital motion of the earth provided a causal explanation for why the planets appeared to meander across the sky .
     [java] 
     [java] While he was speaking she got up and began pacing to and fro across the wide office .
     [java] 
     [java] Asa got up and paced restlessly across the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Leaving Okawi and Beruna , Miles turned away from the village and padded silently across the beach to the tree line .
     [java] 
     [java] Slipping on a light cotton robe , she padded across the thick bedroom carpet , through the large living-room and into the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] Barbara padded across the carpet to the en-suite bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet above the basin .
     [java] 
     [java] He got out of bed and padded across the carpet to his briefcase .
     [java] 
     [java] Would she ever again pad across the grass , barefoot in her bikini ?
     [java] 
     [java] Dillon padded heavily across the room to sink into a chair next to Tweed .
     [java] 
     [java] Her bare feet padded across the polished terracotta tiles to the bottles lined along a shelf in the corner .
     [java] 
     [java] They plodded across the mud .
     [java] 
     [java] Never again a time with such opportunity as from the train that plodded across the flat wilderness lands on the way to the East .
     [java] 
     [java] Henry raised himself on tiptoe and pranced across the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Noreen O'Neil looked good as she pranced across that stage to the catchy Irish tune .
     [java] 
     [java] They prowled across the soft carpet in their elegant high-heeled shoes , and then kicked them off to lounge seductively on the four-poster bed .
     [java] 
     [java] To help him do that , manager Graham Taylor 's best hope of Wright reproducing his Arsenal club form for England will be to let his free spirit roam across Wembley .
     [java] 
     [java] With a whoop of pleasure Kirsty rushed across the room , heading for the door that led out into the hall .
     [java] 
     [java] Lorimer sauntered across the room and sat down on a chair by the butler 's fire .
     [java] 
     [java] The tall black man chuckled , then sauntered across Wavebreaker 's gangplank .
     [java] 
     [java] A grey squirrel , spry after its winter sleep , startled Ben by scampering across his path .
     [java] 
     [java] Cranston turned and quietly cursed as the madman scampered across the snow to greet them , yelping like an affectionate dog .
     [java] 
     [java] Anabelle scrambled across the footbridge to the other side of the canal .
     [java] 
     [java] The mice scurried across the grass to a slender apple tree , and lo and behold -- `` Sunflower seeds ! '' screeched the mice .
     [java] 
     [java] They scurry quickly across the table , keen to get to grips as quickly as possible .
     [java] 
     [java] The little lizard will have scuttled across the beach during the middle of December and man did not appear until the evening of 31 December .
     [java] 
     [java] He scuttled across the rich thick carpet like a toddler , making her laugh .
     [java] 
     [java] Can I scuttle across the ceiling ?
     [java] 
     [java] The remains of a table and chair told of more ordered times , spiders were everywhere , a mouse scuttled across the dirt floor startling the younger children who squeaked with fear .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I never met Barney but I caught sight of the other one once , scuttling across the yard like a nervous rabbit .
     [java] 
     [java] The moon was a slender crescent , and a few tattered clouds shuffled across the perfect dome of blue-black sky .
     [java] 
     [java] I skipped across the baking flagstones , eyes clenched against the brutal light .
     [java] 
     [java] As she spoke the pens of the newspaper reporters seemed to take on a frantic life of their own , skipping across the lines of their notebooks .
     [java] 
     [java] The shadow of our plane skipped across the bright sea , then flickered over the outer coral .
     [java] 
     [java] The owners are not seeing guilty behaviour when Rover slinks across the floor , they are seeing the submissive behaviour Rover displays in anticipation of the aggression , however mild , the owners are about to use in attempt to reprimand him .
     [java] 
     [java] She saw fear slither across his face .
     [java] 
     [java] The moisture seeping out had streaked the hillside with a vivid green line ; just feet from me , a correspondingly green snake slithered silently across the wet patch .
     [java] 
     [java] It must be windy at the top , for he could hear a large object slithering closer across the roof .
     [java] 
     [java] Sneaking across the kitchen she made herself some bread and margarine .
     [java] 
     [java] Like the mark of a slap , an arc of pink sprang across each of the boy 's whitened cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] Lucy screamed and tried to protect her head and face with her arms while Silas sprang across the room and dragged Doreen from her .
     [java] 
     [java] She sprinted across the playground , hampered by her satchel and tennis racket , just as the bus was about to pull away , and leaped aboard .
     [java] 
     [java] And then , suddenly , we all saw him , sprinting across the road towards us .
     [java] 
     [java] He staggered across the bouncing floor to the doorway and cautiously peered out .
     [java] 
     [java] Jamie staggered across the street and collapsed in a pool of blood .
     [java] 
     [java] Stamping across the room , the man made as if to grab Michael 's shirt .
     [java] 
     [java] Loneliness stole across him at the strangest times .
     [java] 
     [java] A look of watchfulness stole across Jane Pargeter 's eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] His mouth caught hers again , and this time the tip of his tongue stole across her lips .
     [java] 
     [java] He had taken only a few steps across the playground when he was stopped by a rough command .
     [java] 
     [java] This time , we succeeded and indeed met no difficulties apart from one awkward step across a gap just before the cairn .
     [java] 
     [java] She took three steps across the nibbled grass and turned .
     [java] 
     [java] Remember how your baby , after weeks of aimless standing around holding onto the fireguard , suddenly took five steps across the room when nobody was looking ?
     [java] 
     [java] They saw three men pushing some steps across the tarmac .
     [java] 
     [java] And so this is how it ends , she thought minutes later as she walked with steady steps across the wooden planks .
     [java] 
     [java] He opened the door wider and hesitantly stepped across the threshold .
     [java] 
     [java] They looked so filthy and disreputable that a woman walking her dog stopped to stare at them as they straggled wearily across the wide , almost deserted beach .
     [java] 
     [java] The breakfast things were still on the table ; the bedclothes lay tangled on the floor ; Tessa 's clothes straggled across the carpet from her open suitcase .
     [java] 
     [java] Hopefully , your loved one is still in one piece and jubilantly striding across Westminster Bridge at the 26.2 mile stage -- the finish .
     [java] 
     [java] A short stroll across the pretty River Leven will take you into the Church where the Cook family worshipped .
     [java] 
     [java] A stroll across the border into Ulster , the breakfast train to Belfast and I 'm on British soil . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Now he 'd slowed down and was strolling across the road towards Peter the Dutchman and the red Jag .
     [java] 
     [java] The land is just as beautiful , and their heroes strut across the world , but only the stupid still feel proud .
     [java] 
     [java] She stumbled across the floor to the door and kicked something .
     [java] 
     [java] He pushed himself back up on to his feet again and started to stumble across the sand to the village .
     [java] 
     [java] In a timed swim across Honolulu Harbour in 1911 he covered 100 yards in 55.4 seconds , shattering the existing record by 4.6 seconds .
     [java] 
     [java] A sponsored swim at Dovercourt swimming pool is planned next month followed by a swim across the Stour later in the year .
     [java] 
     [java] The event begins with a mass start swim across the notorious Narrows from Strangford to Portaferry .
     [java] 
     [java] She 's swimming across the canal ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] When a fish swims across the Earth 's magnetic field , like the coils of a wire in a dynamo , tiny electric currents flow in its body .
     [java] 
     [java] He swam across the lake towards the silted-up island in the middle where a pair of swans nested .
     [java] 
     [java] She tiptoed across the aisle and sat down beside the motionless figure .
     [java] 
     [java] I tiptoed across the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] I would run there , tiptoe across the green tiles and after measurement sprint back to the changing room to put on my gym shoes .
     [java] 
     [java] After a delightful supper we just tottered across the forecourt of the Savoy Grill into the Savoy Theatre -- very intimate -- and we saw a nice show .
     [java] 
     [java] An elderly woman wrapped inside a dressing gown traipsed across the road : `` What 's going on ?
     [java] 
     [java] The small groups who tramped across the Cairngorms with him enjoyed his wit , admired his ability and trusted his leadership .
     [java] 
     [java] She got wearily out of the car and tramped across the car park to the reception lobby , where she asked the receptionist with peroxided hair if she could phone the AA .
     [java] 
     [java] Would millions of people tramp across the hills to look at a twentieth century Broadway Tower ?
     [java] 
     [java] The idea for the first excursion had flashed through his brain as he tramped across the middle of England from Market Harborough to Leicester on his way to attend a temperance meeting .
     [java] 
     [java] Tom tramped across the yard to the back of the house and up the steps .
     [java] 
     [java] After most peoples experiences of travelling on camels they would probably find a penny farthing easier , but Robyn Davidson trekked 1,700 miles across the Australian desert with two camels and a dog for company .
     [java] 
     [java] He opened the door , and they started to troop across the ward to Donna 's room .
     [java] 
     [java] A hundred yards ahead a long line of men trotted slowly across the scarred earth towards some shattered trees and broken walls .
     [java] 
     [java] To their right , a train trundled across Hungerford Bridge .
     [java] 
     [java] To those humans who , given mastery of space , preferred to vault across it than to linger in orbit and build there , Mars and its hurtling moons had been the first great benefit of the gift .
     [java] 
     [java] She waddled cautiously across the living-room , glaring imperiously but ineffectively at the slopping water glasses .
     [java] 
     [java] Dury , paralysed down his left side since contracting polio at seven , waded unsteadily across a floor littered with slang dictionaries and history books .
     [java] 
     [java] Reluctantly , and without much enthusiasm , Blair clambered down the river bank and waded across the stream .
     [java] 
     [java] So still in the adventurous mood of my walk across the field , and my fright at seeing that leg , I rang the police .
     [java] 
     [java] A short walk across Magdalen bridge and you 're in Oxford East territory , not the side of the city that draws the tourists but the Oxford of the Cowley complex and council estates .
     [java] 
     [java] '' So I waltzed him across the road and put him in a doorway and left him for somebody else to find .
     [java] 
     [java] She wandered across the concourse to the Travellers ' Fare buffet and sat warming her hands around a cup of coffee while she waited for her train to arrive .
     [java] 
     [java] Trent half swam and half wriggled across the cockpit to unblock the drainpipes .
     [java] 
     [java] To his relief she wriggled across the seat , leaving room for him to get in beside her .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1913 Studd and his daughter Edith 's young fiance Alfred Buxton , a descendant of the emancipator Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton [ q.v. ] , bicycled across East Africa to a populous region untouched by Christianity .
     [java] 
     [java] As she cycled across the Pariser Platz on the Eastern side , her shrieks of joy echoed in the huge Doric columns of the Brandenburg Gate .
     [java] 
     [java] Two of the Moi carrying short poles followed them to a dugout canoe moored by the camp , and they paddled across the river to the plain on the other side .
     [java] 
     [java] She let out her pent-up breath in a loud gasp of relief ; then she bent over the handlebars and sent the bike whizzing as fast as she could pedal it across the remaining hundred yards or so of field .
     [java] 
     [java] There are too many people nowadays who think they are achieving something by changing the scenery as often as possible : hitchhiking through Europe , peddling across Asia , rowing across the Atlantic and so forth .
     [java] 
     [java] A plastic Santa was sledging across the snow-white surface of a cake .
     [java] 
     [java] Roman lowered himself casually into his large executive swivel-chair behind his desk , and directed a dispassionate , shuttered gaze across the neat expanse of tooled dark green leather .
     [java] 
     [java] I am looking thoughtful , but she is in no mood for meaningful gazes across the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Her confidence was coming back now , so that she felt able to meet his gaze across the width of the small table .
     [java] 
     [java] In silence , Victoria Hamilton gazed across her children 's heads , thinking about their future .
     [java] 
     [java] They stood up and gazed across the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] I nodded and gazed adoringly across the table at those dark , passionate eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] A quick glance across the Channel will confirm that AV delivers none of these .
     [java] 
     [java] He glanced across he canal to the swimming animals .
     [java] 
     [java] He glanced across the table , saw me smiling , interpreted my thought and gave me a slow ironic blink .
     [java] 
     [java] He paused , gave each of them a solemn look across his spectacles and then went on even more deliberately , in his dry old voice .
     [java] 
     [java] He shot her a look across his shoulder .
     [java] 
     [java] Note that if we were looking across the board from left to right the rig would still be relatively upright , as it is being pushed well forwards thereby supplying maximum power .
     [java] 
     [java] She stared defiantly across the cockpit table at me .
     [java] 
     [java] I stared grimly across the room as Lorne babbled on .
     [java] 
     [java] Viewing sunset and dawnrise skyscapes was secondary to viewing each other across the road .
     [java] 
     [java] She winced in pain as she felt a shock across her back at the impact .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he felt a cool draught across his chest and arms as the outer door opened and someone entered the bedroom .
     [java] 
     [java] He had almost reached it when he felt a searing pain across the back of his neck , and realised that he had been slashed with something sharp .
     [java] 
     [java] At the top of a wave she could easily see across the Longstone rock to the other side .
     [java] 
     [java] You could n't hardly see across the room sometimes .
     [java] 
     [java] Senior security sources say they are hampered in their investigations because several of those involved are thought to live across the border outside their jurisdiction .
     [java] 
     [java] A few days later , a lady who lived across the road made the mistake of asking me what sort of bird it had been .
     [java] 
     [java] She stopped half a dozen yards off and pushed her wet hair behind her ears and draped her arms protectively across her undisguised bump .
     [java] 
     [java] They lay together for a while , half asleep , kissing now and again ; then she draped one leg across his hips and they began to make love languorously , without speaking .
     [java] 
     [java] Here the waters are split and piled up either side of a pathway across the sea bed .
     [java] 
     [java] Mary could see a row of white stones marking the pathway across the marsh .
     [java] 
     [java] To his relief she wriggled across the seat , leaving room for him to get in beside her .
     [java] 
     [java] Soon the Jacobite infantry were in full flight , with William himself leading the pursuit across seven miles [ 11 km ] of countryside , where many stragglers died amid the dykes and hedges , though quarter was , on his order , given to all who asked for it .
     [java] 
     [java] We skimmed across the surface of that sodding lake whilst all around us gathered the dark hosts of hell .
     [java] 
     [java] They began hauling their sleds across the Antarctic on November 9 .
     [java] 
     [java] What could be the point of life without that great sweeping tail that could scatter the stars across the sky , without the dark rumbling tenderness when they slept together after their soaring adventures .
     [java] 
     [java] Before drinking he fumbles with a cigarette paper , overloading it with tobacco , scattering flakes across the table , into the booze .
     [java] 
     [java] He scattered his clothes across West London in a variety of dustbins and builder 's skips .
     [java] 
     [java] The waiter spread a napkin across Flora 's knees , presented the menu .
     [java] 
     [java] He opened the folder and spread its contents across the table .
     [java] 
     [java] Over 100,000 civilians fled across the border .
     [java] 
     [java] However it was to no avail : the Orcs swarmed across the river floating on broken timber beams and other debris .
     [java] 
     [java] Many hundreds of rebels swarmed across the roof of a rose-red plate-district , heading for a tree of administrative towers .
     [java] 
     [java] Even the birds which had swarmed across the sky had disappeared .
     [java] 
     [java] Lorton passed a small brown envelope across the table .
     [java] 
     [java] A fine spray of liquid mud and cow-dung showered across the room and , as the brooms hit the wall , ricocheted and settled on their clothes and faces .
     [java] 
     [java] He slept alone in the big double bed , curled up in his stolen greatcoat beneath a single woollen blanket exactly like the one that was nailed across the window .
     [java] 
     [java] I could see it over by the wooden boards that had been nailed across Quigley 's windows .
     [java] 
     [java] Late in 1981 I travelled across northern China , from Peking in the east to Xian , Urumchi , Turpan and Kashgar in the west .
     [java] 
     [java] He had travelled across the city from the suburbs to the apartments of the ruling elite .
     [java] 
     [java] Last week , for example we were looking at the mind boggling distances that we encounter when we journey across the universe .
     [java] 
     [java] From all my travels , and my journeys across the galaxies , I always return to this country , in this time zone .
     [java] 
     [java] Follow this with a journey across the dusty terrain on the wild runaway Mine Train .
     [java] 
     [java] Water was conducted into the meadow via artificially constructed channels and elaborate sluice gates and allowed to flow across the grass .
     [java] 
     [java] The butter was dribbling across that huge mark on his cheek .
     [java] 
     [java] The Antarctic ozone `` hole '' in the stratosphere that splashed across the headlines in 1988 , has continued to grow and is now the size of the USA .
     [java] 
     [java] Having swept across the Bahamas on Aug. 23 , the hurricane ravaged southern Florida in the early hours of Aug. 24 before proceeding westwards across the Gulf of Mexico .
     [java] 
     [java] He was also sensible enough to realise that if he made a sexual advance to Blanche she would slap him across his stubbly moustache .
     [java] 
     [java] He was walking off when I reached out , grabbed him again and slapped him across the head .
     [java] 
     [java] The light from the hall spilled across the multi-coloured counterpane , and he laid her gently in the middle .
     [java] 
     [java] The problem results when acid rainclouds drifting across moorland come into contact with the branches of conifers .
     [java] 
     [java] One cool September Saturday , as the first snowflakes drifted quietly across the picture window , a white-faced , rather exhausted Isobel sat sewing in her living-room .
     [java] 
     [java] Pink clouds with white tipped edges were gliding across the sky .
     [java] 
     [java] Flying low across the track was a formation of swans -- five of them at least -- their anxious , elongated necks rigid with effort ; their great wings beating in slow motion .
     [java] 
     [java] He headed across the Bayswater Road into the park at a brisk pace , knowing he could n't hope to find a pub until he reached Knightsbridge .
     [java] 
     [java] Locking up his desk , he headed across the hall to Sergeant Longbright 's office .
     [java] 
     [java] Stiffly , walking like a machine , he headed across town for his apartment .
     [java] 
     [java] Anthea stalked across the car park of Randall Lodge like a woman with a purpose .
     [java] 
     [java] After a moment , she spun on her heel and stalked across the platform to the door that led to the large communal dressing-room .
     [java] 
     [java] I storm across the board and topple his bishop or something , then turn round and find he 's closed the back door .
     [java] 
     [java] I stormed across the wet barren sands towards the thin line of sea on the distant horizon .
     [java] 
     [java] He touched his temple with his right forefinger and Lee saw again the white scar across his knuckles , a remnant of pain from his childhood , still yelling .
     [java] 
     [java] Jake ferried them across the ford on his cart with horse and master enjoying a paddle .
     [java] 
     [java] Since the tragedy , the Swindon Bus Company has been ferrying the children across town .
     [java] 
     [java] A beam flashed across the runway only a few metres away from the shuttle 's nose .
     [java] 
     [java] He leaned across the counter .
     [java] 
     [java] He leant across the back seat so that he could look up and see her face .
     [java] 
     [java] Benjamin leaned across the table , ticking the points off on his long fingers .
     [java] 
     [java] Brandon then told one of the other group : `` Order your food and leave if you do n't want trouble , or I 'll splatter your face across the road . ''
     [java] 
     [java] A valuable way of concealing them is to have bars , stripes or blobs of colour that appear to overflow from one section to the next , as though someone has splashed ink across the animal .
     [java] 
     [java] She looked up into his face and resisted the urge to snatch the folder from his hand and strew its contents defiantly across the carpet .
     [java]

     [java] North from Chonku Chuli the pink granite mass of Makalu emerged above the seemingly vertical snow walls of the West Col ( 6135 m ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Then the balloons were off rising above Herefordshire to eleven and a half thousand feet instead of the planned ten and a half thousand .
     [java] 
     [java] His tawny skin was stretched tight over the bone , his winged black eyebrows rose above a nose that curved like a falcon 's over his wide mouth .
     [java] 
     [java] He hung his biggest cage above the library entrance but it kept falling down , capturing the Headmaster .
     [java] 
     [java] She forced the sad and crushed skull below the snow and piled the ice above it .

     [java] Fully clothed , enormous in midnight-blue serge suit and peaked cap , he knelt above her , rhythmically slapping her face with a pendulum action of his heavy-gloved hand .
     [java] 
     [java] Her hair was dipping into the water and , stooping above her , Matthew was carefully pouring water from the jug , making a cascade over her hair as it washed the soapy water back into the bath .
     [java] 
     [java] The brown teapot with a slightly broken spout sat like a cold little sentinel on the hob , jackdaws rustled above it in the chimney .
     [java] 
     [java] The man swore at her before turning away , the seagulls screeching above his battered hat .
     [java] 
     [java] A bell tolled above his head .

     [java] 
     [java] The woman lowered her voice so that Ianthe could hardly hear it above the noise of the train .
     [java] 
     [java] It would be untrue to have said it was impossible to hear the Beatles above the screaming .
     [java] 
     [java] The Doctor began to speak , in a voice so quiet Piper wondered how she could hear his words above the storm .
     [java] 
     [java] The spire of St Kentigern 's , seen above the Banks , carries one elongated isosceles triangle of pure white from base to weathercock .

     [java] 
     [java] Oil prices have soared above forty dollars a barrel , their highest level in a decade , which is almost certain to provoke another round of petrol price increases .
     [java] 
     [java] AFTER soaring above $19 a barrel on Tuesday , oil prices fell back last night to $18.84 in spite of an announcement by Iran that it would cut its production next month .

     [java] She was big , well-off , theatrical , and lived above a butcher 's shop in Shepherds Market , Mayfair .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Do you live above the shop ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Later a storm breaks over the hotel ; lightning flares above the mountains across the loch , and the windows rattle as the thunder booms .

     [java] On the headland above Praia do Carvoeiro and overlooking the sea sat the small white local church .
     [java] 
     [java] Sandpipers stalked the dunes above the river in disciplined hunting parties .

     [java] The long desert ridges above the far bank looked like petrified pink brocade .
     [java] 
     [java] I stay local for a night , then climb the ridge above the far side of the fjord , making for Hestefjordur and a view of the big glacier .

     [java] Already the water was bubbling above the metal floor grille on which he was standing and the submarine had adopted a strange , unnatural posture , leaning to one side .
     [java] 
     [java] The bag was increasing its lead , almost out of view , when it arced and plummeted like a kite above the beach and was slammed against a rock .
     [java] 
     [java] As he gazed up into the heights above he noticed a faint thickening of the air as if some of the mist had seeped inside .
     [java] 
     [java] William , bagged in his grubby sleeping suit , lay as always on his back , both arms flung above his head .
     [java] 
     [java] She had rolled over in the night and was sleeping on her back with one arm flung above her head .
     [java] 
     [java] She was solely feeling when he turned again and leaned above her .
     [java]

     [java] He saw Owen redden with pleasure , and laughed , flinging an arm about his shoulders so forgetfully that it was a worthy as well as a willing sacrifice Owen made for him , containing the pain of the embrace .
     [java] 
     [java] `` But I do ! '' she exclaimed , almost throwing herself back into his arms , and frenziedly clasping her hands about his neck .
     [java] 
     [java] It would appear that , while there is a growing increase in awareness about the importance of evaluation in library user education programmes , many librarians still do not systematically evaluate their programmes .
     [java] 
     [java] However , people do not usually live in a state of high intellectual awareness about their every action , but simply get on with living .
     [java] 
     [java] A recent drama festival in Bihar , Central India , showed how it could be used to raise awareness about the region 's marginalised communities .
     [java] 
     [java] This had left a problem in raising public awareness about the shortage because people saw a lot of nurses ( mainly trainees ) around the RVH ; but they are not all qualified to carry out the work .
     [java] 
     [java] And through her appeal she hopes to raise public awareness about the desperate situation many thousands of women with fertility problems are in .
     [java] 
     [java] In the remainder of this chapter I will report some of the attitudes and beliefs about language expressed by some of my young informants .
     [java] 
     [java] Because beliefs about ourselves are self-fulfilling , these people will continue to find themselves in situations in which they can prove themselves right .
     [java] 
     [java] He allowed himself , or claimed to allow himself , no beliefs about the world which could n't be justified if , if , even if only in a very loose sense , by scientific canons of procedure .
     [java] 
     [java] The question '' What do our beliefs about causation come to ? '' , it can be supposed , has no clear and plain answer .
     [java] 
     [java] What are your beliefs about these emotions ?
     [java] 
     [java] The perception of the problem will differ , depending on such things as the views and experiences of individuals , and their beliefs about what is or what ought to be .
     [java] 
     [java] Or your negative beliefs about men ?
     [java] 
     [java] This project compares assumptions incorporated into social policies about these obligations , with people 's beliefs about them , and how such beliefs are put into practice .
     [java] 
     [java] In any society , we find beliefs about language that are simply accepted as common sense .
     [java] 
     [java] True beliefs are n't generally better than false ones in any moral sense : there is usually nothing morally wrong about being mistaken in one 's beliefs about matters of fact .
     [java] 
     [java] But for the quick thinking of the two officers -- the first with his hunch about north Wales , the second with her code breaking -- we might have lost the whole team . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I have a hunch about her -- she is definitely someone to watch for the future .
     [java] 
     [java] His hunch about the morals of blackmailing photographers was right .
     [java] 
     [java] Following his hunch about a probable escape route from the estate , one party entered the woods and followed the line of the perimeter fence to its north-eastern limit .
     [java] 
     [java] `` But I do n't know the first thing about baking , '' stammered Charlie as he fell back into his chair .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I like to know everything about everyone . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` We knew nothing about Paul Mason or Jennifer 's involvement with him , '' said Rachel slowly .
     [java] 
     [java] I did n't really know anything about poetry then , but he was my friend .
     [java] 
     [java] She knows nothing about this deal .
     [java] 
     [java] I know everything about you .
     [java] 
     [java] If he knew about the baby , what would he call me then ?
     [java] 
     [java] `` Did you know about the heroin in those tubes of toothpaste ? '' he asked .
     [java] 
     [java] `` In exchange I 'd love to hear what you know about Sabine Jourdain painting for Durance .
     [java] 
     [java] Another advantage of small chips with few address lines is that each cell of a chip only stores a very crude fragment of knowledge about the image on the retina .
     [java] 
     [java] The problem is dealt with mainly by presumptions about normal people .
     [java] 
     [java] Each model can cope with all the evidence and the choice between them is thrown back on criteria like elegance , economy , fruitfulness , or perhaps , indeed , conformity with deep underlying presumptions about human nature .
     [java] 
     [java] I think you should wait for that and do n't make any presumptions about the future of the runway .
     [java] 
     [java] Shakespeare 's drama is celebrated for its poetry , a compliment that on the surface suggests ideologically neutral approval of its language , but which also belies suppositions about the attitudes the plays ' language articulates .
     [java] 
     [java] There were suspicions about the role that Conservative Central Office played in orchestrating some of these manoeuvres .
     [java] 
     [java] Fate , it seemed , had played right into Luke 's hands , confirming his suspicions about her with illuminating certainty and damning her as a liar .
     [java] 
     [java] Perhaps it was part of a plan to hurt her , to punish her , for her unhappy suspicions about him .
     [java] 
     [java] They also had a deep suspicion about anyone wearing a bandage and would go to great lengths to find out why one was really wearing it .
     [java] 
     [java] He must show , on the balance of probabilities , both that he did not examine the article and that he entertained no suspicions about the nature of its contents .
     [java] 
     [java] I did n't think about Francis any more that night .
     [java] 
     [java] I thought carefully about what he had said .
     [java] 
     [java] She has encouraged me to talk about what happened before I got to that stage , and to think about what might have led up to it .
     [java] 
     [java] He did n't allow himself to think about Zoe until he arrived at the field entrance to the cottage .
     [java] 
     [java] Religion was the first vehicle for general thoughts about existence .
     [java] 
     [java] He felt safe with Jordan , and for this reason viciously pushed all thoughts about Zambia to the back of his mind .
     [java] 
     [java] And it was certainly an improvement on my thoughts about the core curriculum .
     [java] 
     [java] With planning it is possible for all of us to clarify our thoughts about our hopes and future needs .
     [java] 
     [java] As a result , Mario is no admirer of socialism in any form -- though , quite untypically of racing drivers , he has some serious thoughts about politics .
     [java] 
     [java] But what were his thoughts about his duties as archbishop ?
     [java] 
     [java] He checked the door of the church was locked and stood engrossed in his own thoughts about Cranston .
     [java] 
     [java] I thought you understood about coitus , I thought you appreciated what being my licentiate entailed ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] He thought he understood now about Zoser .
     [java] 
     [java] He was most understanding about the needs of our party .
     [java] 
     [java] There must always be the fear that , however good a writer may be involved , the depiction of mental handicap will be unrealistic because the writer will have no real understanding about the subject .
     [java] 
     [java] Two people who speak the same language can always work towards an understanding about what each of them is talking about and what each of them wishes to achieve by what they say .
     [java] 
     [java] The parents needed not only extensive marital therapy but also to realize that Suzy needed sympathy and understanding about the distress she felt when her parents argued .
     [java] 
     [java] The Princess had spent the previous day reading Love and Pain , Sandra 's book on violent relationships , and was able to speak with some understanding about domestic violence .
     [java] 
     [java] Now that the group has come to a better understanding about some aspect of these problems , how can they feel Empowered to act for change ?
     [java] 
     [java] Kohler thought that insight , or sudden understanding about what is required to produce a desired effect was shown by the chimpanzees in his experiments .
     [java] 
     [java] The book was open at Pythagoras ' discovery about the relative lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle , and Hobbes was amazed by Euclid 's proof of this complex idea .
     [java] 
     [java] The first was a remarkable discovery about Lord of the Flies .
     [java] 
     [java] SERAFIN : You sound as if you are making a cautious discovery about your feelings for the first time .
     [java] 
     [java] Nevertheless , if we are ever to make new discoveries about intonation , it will be as a result of studying what people actually say rather than inventing examples of what they might say .
     [java] 
     [java] I know you 're unhappy , but you ca n't sit indoors and brood about it all day . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It was no use brooding about it , but what else could she do ?
     [java] 
     [java] But Carrie brooded about it all the same .
     [java] 
     [java] I 've been brooding about that myself ever since I heard .
     [java] 
     [java] `` You 're still brooding about Rosie , are n't you ? '' he said .
     [java] 
     [java] In spite of all this , the design process itself is often thought about and executed without any formal considerations about people .
     [java] 
     [java] This leads on to some general considerations about decision-making in a bureaucracy .
     [java] 
     [java] Our interest in standard mechanisms for data encoding and exchange need not be driven , then , by altruistic considerations about the value of secondary analysis .
     [java] 
     [java] General considerations about this sort of thing .
     [java] 
     [java] I have an awful suspicion that morning TV here could soon lurch towards its American counterpart , with deep daily deliberations about you and your psyche/milkman/rocking horse/ puma/postman .
     [java] 
     [java] The middle of the passage was , however , rather different since it concerned a motorcyclist 's deliberations about the nature of empiricism , and it was considerably more difficult to understand .
     [java] 
     [java] As we become more proficient in meditating about the `` I and Thou '' , so will we find more beauty .
     [java] 
     [java] After dinner Leonora returned to her knitting , glad of its soothing monotony , when Penry began musing about her background .
     [java] 
     [java] Charles and Diana frequently visited their brother John 's lichen-covered grave in the Sandringham churchyard and mused about what he would have been like and whether they would have been born if he had lived .
     [java] 
     [java] They would be moving , and he pondered about that move , thinking about the gun .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The party needs a period of serious reflection about what went wrong and what needs to be done .
     [java] 
     [java] But Christian Aid has also recognised -- for example in grants to the Institute of Contextual Theology in South Africa -- the value of church groups ' reflection about development in support of its practice .
     [java] 
     [java] What , then , can we conclude about the contribution that political sociology has made to understanding more clearly the main trends of political change in the twentieth century , and to influencing the course of events ?
     [java] 
     [java] Drucker concluded about decision analysis that : `` A decision should always be made at lowest level and as close to the scene of action as possible
     [java] 
     [java] Presentations of costs of residential and fostering care and intermediate treatment which ignore these important considerations can result in unjustified conclusions about cost effectiveness .
     [java] 
     [java] The main conclusion about education and employment was that purely educational aims came first : schools should not prepare pupils for particular types of employment ; industry itself benefited from the teaching and learning of basic educational skills .
     [java] 
     [java] I 've come to a lot of conclusions about myself within the last four months .
     [java] 
     [java] As you can see , I 've never had as much difficulty in coming to a conclusion about any piece of software .
     [java] 
     [java] Of particular significance to our discussion in this chapter is her conclusion about the way in which technology appears to influence organisational structure at the two ends of the scale of technological complexity .
     [java] 
     [java] Darwin and Wallace came to the same conclusion about archipelago birds .
     [java] 
     [java] As viewers of this scene we could also have deduced something about the relationship between John and Mary from the way they were sitting together and the way they looked at each other .
     [java] 
     [java] In these circumstances facile and fallacious deductions about the consequences of having abolished the death penalty were bound to be rife .
     [java] 
     [java] The basic answer lies in the guesses about future cash flow .
     [java] 
     [java] People may vote with one hand on their wallets , but their guesses about future prosperity are tangled up with judgments of the competing politicians .
     [java] 
     [java] It appeared that my guess about the tide had been near enough .
     [java] 
     [java] So let me begin by making some impressionistic guesses about the views women do in fact currently hold on morality .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Can you make any guesses about who might have done this ? '' asked Jean .
     [java] 
     [java] And now he found himself wondering whether she knew or guessed about Amy .
     [java] 
     [java] How much could you guess about a conversation between two people walking along a country lane for example ?
     [java] 
     [java] He had wondered , also , how much the mediciner had been able to guess about his own mind and nature .
     [java] 
     [java] Second , when making an assessment , information about what a child is able to do in one situation must necessarily form the basis of inferences about what a child might be able to do in other situations .
     [java] 
     [java] In order to draw causal inferences about the educational consequences of being in care , a longitudinal study has been designed .
     [java] 
     [java] Using animals in experiments requires us to make inferences about psychological processes from behaviour .
     [java] 
     [java] Inferences about mind are thus made from descriptions .
     [java] 
     [java] In order to draw causal inferences about the educational consequences of being in care , a longitudinal study has been designed .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I learned a lot about men , '' she said .
     [java] 
     [java] But you can t spend a lifetime in a shipping office without learning something about ships .
     [java] 
     [java] I had learned something about the protest vote .
     [java] 
     [java] I was aware of the enormous distances , especially for those in the West , although I learned a lot more about this simply be being there .
     [java] 
     [java] There is still much to learn about this family of chemicals and it is obviously prudent to reduce the levels wherever practicable to do so .
     [java] 
     [java] We are aware that many employees are interested to learn about what Wood Group companies do and where they are located .
     [java] 
     [java] In the next few days Creggan began to learn about the Zoo in which he was now imprisoned .
     [java] 
     [java] As Jaq questioned Meh'Lindi yet again so as to compare her impressions with his , a sickening realization about the probable nature of the hydra dawned on him .
     [java] 
     [java] Now write as much as you can about Auntie the sort of person she was , what members of her family thought of her , what her niece realises about her at the end .
     [java] 
     [java] In fact , she noticed , there was something ever so slightly contemptuous about his expression .
     [java] 
     [java] There is a social stigma about suicide and his family do n't believe he did it .
     [java] 
     [java] This found that girls who had felt isolated and embarrassed about being pregnant or having babies felt less stigma about this after they had attended the units and could take a much more realistic view of their situation .
     [java] 
     [java] Though literary festivals could be immensely enjoyable , especially if they took you to some pleasant distant city , like Toronto or Adelaide , there was something absurd about writers gathering together in this way .
     [java] 
     [java] And I ' m fairly canny about my career , despite what you might think .
     [java] 
     [java] She is careless about her possessions , even though she enjoys them -- the houses , the cars , the money .
     [java] 
     [java] You should be as devious and cunning about this as the book is itself .
     [java] 
     [java] MOST New Yorkers are cynical about current efforts to clean mobsters out of their city 's waste-disposal business - - and with good reason .
     [java] 
     [java] Not having done very well at school ( not even allowed to sit the Oxbridge exams ) , she had nevertheless been diligent about her piano lessons , and was in fact quite good on the instrument .
     [java] 
     [java] Increased awareness of `` green '' issues , together with fierce competition , means consumers are more discerning about the environmental impact of the products they buy .
     [java] 
     [java] Basil could read with ease the natural image-making of children and was in fact deeply knowledgeable and perceptive about the developmental stages of children 's drawings .
     [java] 
     [java] Indeed she had been sharp and perceptive about people .
     [java] 
     [java] `` But so are you , '' I protested , really astonished because he had been so reasonable about my activities up to now .
     [java] 
     [java] In its early days software is tested by programmers and expert , hand picked users , who tend to be reasonable about they way they use machines .
     [java] 
     [java] You knew he was smart about cars ; he was savvy about life too .
     [java] 
     [java] To be blunt about it , the challenge confronting Mr Heseltine is how to maintain his momentum .
     [java] 
     [java] Yet this does not stop him being blunt about Rhoda the Rhino -- otherwise known as Margaret Thatcher
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm his sister , so I can be blunt about it .
     [java] 
     [java] Once the client has received his or her compensation , they are often prepared to be quite candid about the way the case was handled .
     [java] 
     [java] Officials are coy about the details .
     [java] 
     [java] Conservative Central Office is coy about his involvement , still maintaining that Major writes his own speeches .
     [java] 
     [java] Official reports into local government administration have in the past been extremely coy about the significance of such Partisanship for the matters they investigated .
     [java] 
     [java] The Labour party has become ever so coy about the details of its renationalisation plans .
     [java] 
     [java] The hon. Member for Sedgefield has been uncharacteristically coy about the Labour party 's attitude to training credits .
     [java] 
     [java] Why be coy about it ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] And secondly , and very much wrapped up in the same point with this , they 're also coy about the sort of people they 're looking for .
     [java] 
     [java] The Soviet news agency , Tass , was also explicit about developments in Romania , stating that `` tension was high '' inside Timisoara .
     [java] 
     [java] So a national curriculum in English must reflect our values and beliefs , and we need to be as explicit about these as possible .
     [java] 
     [java] A self-appointed leader , he made the rules without being explicit about them or even explaining that there were rules .
     [java] 
     [java] She could hardly have been much of a friend of Liza because , although her daughter had never been forthcoming about her time in the ATS , she had certainly never mentioned an Eleanor Fuller .
     [java] 
     [java] Not too forthcoming about himself , was he ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] He was quite frank about the whole thing , told us H. had given him a fiver to turn up , asked Madge if she wanted to go through with it , which of course she did n't .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Let us be frank about it , '' he said .
     [java] 
     [java] Macmillan was very frank about his personal preference .
     [java] 
     [java] Lessing -- for us the first of these theoreticians -- is quite frank about the strictly functional purpose of his concern with Aristotle .

     [java] In fact Elisa was not being entirely honest about her situation .
     [java] 
     [java] Write yourself a new script in which you are open and honest about your anger .
     [java] 
     [java] In many instances , no doubt , it 's true , but Canon Ian Hardaker , clergy appointments adviser , is refreshingly honest about the need to improve the intellectual calibre of the would- be clergy .
     [java] 
     [java] Always be honest about your intentions or you may regret it later .
     [java] 
     [java] Be honest about your own feelings ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Well , if that 's the reason they should at least be honest about it .
     [java] 
     [java] Where the tutorial focuses on current productions , I have found that students will work hard on their performances and be open about their work and any problems they may be having with the characters they are playing .
     [java] 
     [java] You need to be open about the way you have chosen to behave .
     [java] 
     [java] Emotional awareness , ie being open about feelings and having empathy for how other people are feeling
     [java] 
     [java] Whatever the strength of Phillip 's affection for Marje , he was open about the void that Meli had left in his life .
     [java] 
     [java] Equally , many countries would do well to acknowledge the honesty of subSaharan nations in being largely open about the nature and scale of the epidemic within their borders .
     [java] 
     [java] You were so open about your admiration for him .
     [java] 
     [java] World Cup assistant coach Bob Templeton , an indomitable figure in most things rugby for more than 20 years , is outspoken about the game guiding its future .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Many people will note that British ministers and other politicians are not as outspoken about other deaths arising out of this conflict .
     [java] 
     [java] Although outspoken about others , Fenton was naturally shy and very sensitive to criticism of himself .
     [java] 
     [java] In fact , he was often quite outspoken about people , though usually with reference to their harmless foibles .
     [java] 
     [java] `` She was n't outspoken about her political views .
     [java] 
     [java] I am often secretive about what I eat , trying to hide it from my friends and family .
     [java] 
     [java] There was no intention to be secretive about the Iraqi contract and there is no cover up .
     [java] 
     [java] Whatever the courtesy , the Profitboss is sincere about it .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm completely sincere about it , '' he said .
     [java] 
     [java] And Fry was straightforward about his own perceptions .
     [java] 
     [java] Both books imply what childhood should be like by being very straightforward about the present reality for all too many of the world 's children .
     [java] 
     [java] This sounds counter-productive , but the theory is that all those self-employed lawyers and doctors and dentists will be more truthful about their income if the government is demanding less of it from them .
     [java] 
     [java] The spivs will wave away any objections with promises about easy resale , low cost finance and tiny deposit payments .
     [java] 
     [java] The politicians made vague promises about independence .
     [java] 
     [java] Videotapes of school activities are a useful means of communicating about work undertaken at school .
     [java] 
     [java] Improved communication about children and the problems which they faced outside school was not simply a consequence of a rapidly changing society .
     [java] 
     [java] There is a good deal of informal communication about courses in particular subjects , some of it passing along the external examiner grapevine , some of it through the `` invisible colleges '' of research networks .
     [java] 
     [java] But some of the headmasters have a deliberate multi-denominational policy in terms of ethos and curriculum and the schools do provide multi-denominational settings which , if researched , could throw light on debates about denominational and shared schools .
     [java] 
     [java] One said : `` Every time there is debate about women in the services , they produce stories of widespread sex as an argument against us . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The football authorities have debated endlessly about the impact of these changes on their game .
     [java] 
     [java] The second step is promoting participatory dialogue about these concerns .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy .
     [java] 
     [java] On the other hand , there are those on both sides whom I would label `` meaning '' theists and `` meaning '' atheists , between whom a dialogue about God 's existence can take place .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy .
     [java] 
     [java] The record of his own work and ideas meant that the only dull part of this programme was a tired , conventional exchange about the balance between pure and applied research .
     [java] 
     [java] It is unique in its opportunities to establish from the outset good habits in terms of expectations of parental involvement and willingness to participate in honest exchange about the child 's progress .
     [java] 
     [java] Some exchange about holidays , even the weather , sets the scene ; then the interview can begin .
     [java] 
     [java] He and I have had a series of meetings about the provision of the slip road , and he reminded me of an undertaking that I had given when Minister responsible for health matters a few years ago .
     [java] 
     [java] We have had a few meetings about the rule but they have always brought in extra bodies to out-vote us .
     [java] 
     [java] She said neither company had bothered to attend a public meeting about the proposed speed restrictions .
     [java] 
     [java] Prof Dick Van Velzen , of Liverpool University 's Department of Foetal and Infant Pathology , said : `` We held a meeting about this on Thursday and Friday .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Was that the meeting about women and the family ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] On one occasion she planned to fly up to Scotland for a meeting about the children 's work .
     [java] 
     [java] She said neither company had bothered to attend a public meeting about the proposed speed restrictions .
     [java] 
     [java] Wycliffe said : `` Obviously you 've heard about Francis Garland -- how did you hear , by the way ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] No doubt we shall hear about the street children from Amnesty other sources from time to time .
     [java] 
     [java] He read about the unemployed in newspapers and saw films about them on television , pacing across photogenic sections of contemporary Britain and muttering darkly about waste and emptiness .
     [java] 
     [java] He kept babbling then about some fiend that had taken possession of him .
     [java] 
     [java] But I can remember my father coming back from the death bed and saying the old man was babbling about a grandson .
     [java] 
     [java] He chattered about bills of sale , the purchase of canvas and parchment , the cost of carters and the money needed for ship and crew .
     [java] 
     [java] Benjamin appeared to be in better humour and chattered about the history of the chateau as we broke our fast in the great hall .
     [java] 
     [java] At first she was shy but then she chattered about Nantes , how she missed the dark woods and green fields of Brittany .

     [java] Leila threw herself on Quincx , gabbling about what happened .
     [java] 
     [java] He jabbered about football for the first five minutes to smother her angry silence .
     [java] 
     [java] The girl , obviously acutely embarrassed , mumbled something about Bert maybe knowing a bit more , `` him being there , like '' .
     [java] 
     [java] He mumbles some nonsense about clowns being the cause of peace -- perhaps the money for the convention is the peace dividend ?
     [java] 
     [java] Waller , still retreating , turning away to go back into his room , had mumbled something about something or other .
     [java] 
     [java] Only one old lay brother , a hoary old man , mumbled about the abbey being the dark pit for the evil deeds of the Great Ones of the land . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` Nothing of importance , he just mumbled about shadows , shadows on the Kinghorn Ness .
     [java] 
     [java] Rutherford was muttering something about a by-pass always changing a country community , as if he felt the need to apologise for the place .
     [java] 
     [java] Lord Wakeham , who had come with the necessary cheque , had muttered something about boys being boys , and that Robertson would do well to go to his hotel and sleep it off .
     [java] 
     [java] Sir John had then stamped off , muttering curses about public officials who did n't seem to care .
     [java] 
     [java] He muttered something about the place being primitive .
     [java] 
     [java] He turned away , muttering something about Vincent 's vicious character .

     [java] 
     [java] Gran had been muttering about storms for days and she liked her to stay close at these times .
     [java] 
     [java] Debussy 's answer to a journalist who asked if he was familiar with heaven -- `` yes , but I do n't natter about it with strangers '' - is not so silly as it sounds .
     [java] 
     [java] Like so many kindly , amiable people , he was a confirmed gossip and loved to prattle about his friends ' affairs .
     [java] 
     [java] He was raving about Armageddon and the fires of hell .
     [java] 
     [java] A farmer has every right to rant and rave about such clowns .
     [java] 
     [java] He raved about Hitchcock , about Bogart and Raymond Chandler .
     [java] 
     [java] Basically everyone raved about Leeds that day -- and Tuesday was a comfortable if a little uninspired .
     [java] 
     [java] If the popular music press start raving about you , people will flock to your gigs .
     [java] 
     [java] But in contrast to Mama Mosambiki 's oblique approach , the Kafala Brothers have chosen in this album to sing directly about the cruelty and devastation of civil war in Angola .
     [java] 
     [java] It is not surprising that he found in addition to writing about her , he had to sing about her , too .
     [java] 
     [java] `` But I 'll argue until the day I die that we are singing about something serious .
     [java] 
     [java] I just sing about stuff that 's directly involved with me . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` If you so much as whisper a word about Dame Agatha to the Lady Maeve , you will regret the day I ever plucked you out of Newgate ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] I 've had enough of being talked about , everybody whispering about Auntie Mavis 's seances , everybody blaming me just for living with her . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Outside , she and Oliver whispered about Shildon .
     [java] 
     [java] As we pass a couple of girl guests clad in complete colour-coordinated beachwear outfits , they whisper about us .
     [java] 
     [java] All you did was sit round like some old colonel in an Agatha Christie book , bellowing about the country going to the dogs .
     [java] 
     [java] When the firemen finally arrived I pointed at the sacrificial pyre still burning and burbled something about my priceless slide-collection .
     [java] 
     [java] This allowed the company to crow about the new models that cost no more than the old -- a favourite Ford device but by no means exclusive to the blue oval badge .
     [java] 
     [java] Those who thought it would fall to pieces within 5000 miles were confounded , even if those who hoped it would sail the test with BMW-like dependability could hardly crow about its reliability record .
     [java] 
     [java] Well who are the ones that are moaning and groaning about it ?
     [java] 
     [java] When I got there they moaned about all the clothes and stuff I had , because you have to take everything with you when they move you about .
     [java] 
     [java] Second , MPs moan about the cramped conditions they work in .
     [java] 
     [java] We can compare the growth of our peas and beans , and moan about the weather .

     [java] 
     [java] Every few years , people in industrial circles murmur about what would happen if supplies were cut off , for political or commercial reasons .
     [java] 
     [java] Apart from all the weird letters I get from Scotsman readers , there are continuous phone calls to my house , maniacal voices who scream hoarsely about deadlines and copy .
     [java] 
     [java] The strongest disapproval often comes from those who scream about liberties if their own particular indulgences -- for assault rifles , say -- are attacked .
     [java] 
     [java] And then Mike ran off screaming about snakes .
     [java] 
     [java] The opposition is screaming about a '' travesty of democracy '' .
     [java] 
     [java] I am resisting the temptation to thunder about AIDS being a judgment upon them , etc .
     [java] 
     [java] THE PUNK generation now spend half their time whining about the smothering blanket of baby boomer nostalgia .
     [java] 
     [java] They do n't sweat and whine about their condition , they do n't lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The other waitress whined about the increased work when Sharon explained what was happening but Blanche silenced her with a steely glare .
     [java] 
     [java] Service wives did not grill their husbands about bloody work .

     [java] 
     [java] She grilled him about women she saw in hotel lobbies , as if he knew each one personally .
     [java] 
     [java] I was not prepared to travel 140 miles to and from work each day , nor to live away from home on a long term basis , so I inquired about part time training .
     [java] 
     [java] A lot of people are inquiring about remortgages but often when they find out what exactly is involved they are happy to stay where they are .
     [java] 
     [java] Let ministers of local churches have copies as a good exercise in public relations and also just in case they have new members of their flock inquiring about schools in the area .
     [java] 
     [java] SHOE repairer Alan Potts announced his good news in big letters after being inundated with inquiries about his daughter 's new baby .
     [java] 
     [java] He made the usual inquiries about her health and escaped into the kitchen to make the coffee .
     [java] 
     [java] Hordes of listeners rushed to the beach to catch a glimpse of the star and the cameras , and inundated the radio station with inquiries about the exact location .
     [java] 
     [java] Jovial inquiries about illegal subsidies to industry , Rover for instance , got short shrift .
     [java] 
     [java] An information office is shortly to be set up by East Hampshire District Council to answer queries about the drainage work taking place in the village .
     [java] 
     [java] He thanked her but countered cunningly with a query about who her friends might be .
     [java] 
     [java] If you have a query about information mentioned in a particular feature ask the person who wrote it !
     [java] 
     [java] With that check came renewed questioning about the balance between services provided by the social services departments and the many forms of family , neighbourhood and commercially purchased care that they supplemented .
     [java] 
     [java] She also had to parry some delighted but pointed questioning about Rohan .
     [java] 
     [java] In general , responses to direct or indirect questioning about non-standard varieties are always conditioned by speakers ' awareness of their social significance and usually reflect knowledge of the standard rules .
     [java] 
     [java] Tactful questioning about bowel habit is usually part of patient assessment in surgical wards for several reasons :

     [java] With that check came renewed questioning about the balance between services provided by the social services departments and the many forms of family , neighbourhood and commercially purchased care that they supplemented .
     [java] 
     [java] Wafting vague answers about DNA are totally inadequate in the face of such mysteries .
     [java] 
     [java] He ca n't give me any straight answers about all this because he is only concerned with the state-run prison service .
     [java] 
     [java] Answers about personal qualities and abilities are harder to interpret , although experience does make it easier .
     [java] 
     [java] Leon Brittan , made a statement in a written Parliamentary answer about the release of prisoners on parole licences .
     [java] 
     [java] He was midway through a wobbly answer about sex , about losing his virginity .
     [java] 
     [java] She wanted to make some sarcastic retort about his being so bossy , but he was already clearing away the plates , not paying the slightest scrap of attention to her , and she realised that it was this lack of attention that really annoyed her .
     [java] 
     [java] Draw a plan on each page to show where the colour is each month , and add comments about future planting .
     [java] 
     [java] We would like to add comments about its use relevant to non-anaesthetists .
     [java] 
     [java] Speaker A offers no contribution and speaker B adds some additional information about telephones .
     [java] 
     [java] The unprecedented admission about the state of the royal marriage yesterday, on the last day of their Korean tour, was what the Princess of Wales has waited since June 7 to hear.
     [java] 
     [java] I do not know whether admissions about the past are as important as agreement about the future.
     [java] 
     [java] The reports were stimulated by Italian government admissions about the existence of a secret force, code-named '' Gladio '' , and allegations about the involvement of Gladio in right-wing extremist action.
     [java] 
     [java] Whatever the strength of Danny Gardiners allegations about drug dealing in jail , it 's clear that staff at Gloucester prison are happy that there 's no major drug problem behind the prison walls .
     [java] 
     [java] When interviewed by complaints department officers he made similar allegations about fabrication of admissions .
     [java] 
     [java] The allegation about a metal object being contained in one of the bags is new to me .
     [java] 
     [java] `` My superiors would have dismissed Graham 's allegations about my past as the ramblings of a broken man .
     [java] 
     [java] And the same general pattern applied , in a much weaker form , to allegations about ITV .
     [java] 
     [java] The bishop 's spokesman Canon Andy Radford said : `` It must be emphasised that no charges have been brought against the bishop and the allegations about him are unsubstantiated .

     [java] 
     [java] There are lots of shirty assertions about independence , few actively demonstrated .
     [java] 
     [java] The trouble is that museum exhibitions , as traditionally arranged , do little more than offer a catalogue of seemingly-unrelated assertions about the subject matter .
     [java] 
     [java] Given this assertion about the sexual nature of social ties , it is incumbent upon sociologists to examine the arguments , the conceptualizations and the observations which led Freud to this position .
     [java] 
     [java] The assertion about the murder of the father setting problems for the unconscious life of all later generations has been left unexamined in anthropology and sociology .
     [java] 
     [java] `` People are gaining confidence in the profession to make assertions about the importance of values and ethical judgments . ''
     [java] 
     [java] RECENT Tory boasts about the health service simply wo n't stand up to close scrutiny .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Groenewald 's boast about hundreds of thousands of white soldiers assumes rather too blithely that ex-conscripts will rally to the cause .
     [java] 
     [java] He remembered telling Michael , the albino boy , about her , boasting about her beauty .
     [java] 
     [java] Sarah made no secret of her past , she even boasted about her many conquests and it seemed that she was leading poor Tom Parks around like a bull with a ring through its nose .
     [java] 
     [java] But we do n't boast about it .
     [java] 
     [java] In public they have to boast about the training revolution they are supposedly leading .
     [java] 
     [java] Yet her father was being stupid , bragging about the business .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Teachers of art are more likely to write books of instruction , and in their efforts to educate their students may make comments about the traditions they admire and from which they hope their students will learn .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Day was not at home to comment about his departure .
     [java] 
     [java] He complained about Tory colleagues : `` They do n't know what it is to run out of money at the end of the week . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Maybe the American government should note this before it complains about the success of Japanese business .
     [java] 
     [java] Throughout the late 1890s the police had been bothered by complaints about young boys throwing stones or spitting from the London bridges on to boats and their passengers below .
     [java] 
     [java] Well now , I had a complaint about you this morning .
     [java] 
     [java] Wilkinson 's third case , a rubber-moulding company , exemplifies his contention about the political nature of the process of establishing new patterns of work organisation .
     [java] 
     [java] Contentions about the excessive harshness of the courts to women offenders really have two aspects .
     [java]

     [java]

     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] `` If one of my lecturers had been murdered , I would n't like to hear someone gloating about the details . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I might even have griped about my existence with the Gorengs and thought wistfully of alternatives .
     [java] 
     [java] You gripe about your mother and I gripe about mine .
     [java] 
     [java] You gripe about your mother and I gripe about mine .
     [java] 
     [java] They grumbled about the hardships of the journey .
     [java] 
     [java] So , in making their denials , they often make unseemly proclamations about their own heterosexuality , in the worst cases ( only too common ) dis themselves from `` radical feminists '' ( read lesbians ) and presenting themselves as the ones who are the reasonable moderates .
     [java] 
     [java] Here evolutionary science was fully integrated with moral pronouncements about society 's future progress or decline .
     [java] 
     [java] Any pronouncement about educational technology needs to be scrutinized with great care to ascertain what meaning is intended -- the machines , the machines in use , or a methodology .
     [java] 
     [java] Behaviour is observed and measured from the outside , and propositions about behavioural patterns are readily testable and controllable .
     [java] 
     [java] It leaves the notion of understanding untouched ; Hume seems to agree that we understand propositions about unobserved objects , although he does argue on independent grounds that they are mostly false .
     [java] 
     [java] The main idea here is that existential propositions can be paraphrased in terms of propositions about knowledge .
     [java] 
     [java] If lawyers think a particular proposition about legislation is true by convention , they will not think they need any substantive reason for accepting it .
     [java]

     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Saidi Safari , a local Muslim trader , came forward to pay the fines but was himself arrested shortly afterwards -- possibly for making critical remarks about the incident .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I remarked about the glass being dirty .
     [java] 
     [java] Clearly the auction house feels that in the light of new revelations about the treasure 's origins , its manner of acquisition and details of falsified export licenses , any attempt to offer it at auction would be bound to result in failure and would not redound to the auction house 's credit .
     [java] 
     [java] You might discover that someone else such as the bride 's mother has really interesting revelations about the bride .
     [java] 
     [java] Indeed , Greene 's latest revelations about his faith-non-faith appear quite knowingly hilarious .
     [java] 
     [java] Sniffy was reasonably pleased to see them as the Goad men had been about to wreak vengeance on him for his revelations about the prison release dates being changed .
     [java] 
     [java] Where the book scores is in its revelations about attitudes towards opera management and about deals that went on behind the scenes .
     [java] 
     [java] That was the date sensational revelations about her unhappy life with Charles were first published in Andrew Morton 's book Diana : Her True Story .
     [java] 
     [java] Clearly the auction house feels that in the light of new revelations about the treasure 's origins , its manner of acquisition and details of falsified export licenses , any attempt to offer it at auction would be bound to result in failure and would not redound to the auction house 's credit .
     [java] 
     [java] His resignation , and the subsequent revelations about his personal life , caused widespread shock in Ireland .
     [java] 
     [java] It was obvious from that answer that the Secretary of State has nothing whatsoever to say about steel .
     [java] 
     [java] I remembered all the things Mum and Dad had said about strangers and when a man slowed down when he saw me and said `` What 's up , dear ?
     [java] 
     [java] But his enthusiasm is far more apparent when he speaks about Christopher -- who has a non-verbal IQ of between 40 and 70 -- and their extraordinary first meeting .
     [java] 
     [java] He speaks about the archaeological finds that have been made in Cyprus 's mines -- the reed ore baskets , the wooden winches and woven ropes , the skeletons cramped in galleries less than one metre high .
     [java] 
     [java] He was not to know that because she never spoke about her feelings , she could not express them on demand .
     [java] 
     [java] And such a sentence need n't be confined to the characters of the Bible ; words like those ought to be part of the way that you and I speak about our lives .
     [java] 
     [java] Yesterday , speaking exclusively to TODAY , Mandy revealed how shocked she was by Wyman 's decision to speak about his marriage break-up .
     [java] 
     [java] Women were empowered to speak about sex , challenging the authority of the experts and drawing attention to their gendered power relations .
     [java] 
     [java] You are making a statement about a child and it is going on the child's record. ''
     [java] 
     [java] I suggest that the general public also regard statements about animal tested products with caution, as it is well known that many of these products have had extremely adverse effects on human beings.
     [java] 
     [java] As Feynman has said, we are asked to believe that the historian who makes a statement about Napoleon simply means that there are books in libraries which make assertions similar to his own.
     [java] 
     [java] The discussion was general ; Jenny talked about her flying experiences whilst Billie reminisced about the warmth of her native Southern California .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I ca n't even talk about his future in the game because it 's too early to say .
     [java] 
     [java] David acknowledged the complexity of Peru 's problems yet he remained an optimist , becoming most heated when he talked about those who repeated endlessly that Peru was a poor country .
     [java] 
     [java] After he got home to Scotland he would write about Elsie , perhaps not just for the paper but for himself too .
     [java] 
     [java] You 're not going to write about this ? '
     [java] 
     [java] In another letter to Annette , he wrote about love and its problems .
     [java] 
     [java] Another Sussex colleague , John Harrison , erm followed this through erm for the nineteenth century , and he 's written about the Shakers and I 've been interested in the Muddletonians and the Ranters .
     [java] 
     [java] Possibly monastic writers may have been slightly less chauvinist in outlook ; the St Albans chronicler at least is less effusive about Agincourt , although he too notes the triumphant reception which the King received on his return ( 16 , p.111 ; 22 , p.70 ; 39 , pp.xviii , 98-9 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Afterwards he was reticent about the ill-fortune which has plagued him .
     [java] 
     [java] The ex-CID officer was more reticent about the perks of the job , more willing to see those offers as the practice in other forces .
     [java] 
     [java] A PENSIVE Prince Charles ventures a wry smile yesterday , staying silent about his friendship with Camilla Parker Bowles .
     [java] 
     [java] Not all men are defensive or get upset if you raise this subject ; keeping silent about your concerns may put both your health and well-being at risk and wo n't help your relationship in the long term .
     [java] 
     [java] The Act is silent about the criteria for admission to membership .
     [java] 
     [java] But that English sources are silent about Hiring and trouble in the north in the 980s is not particularly significant : there is much silence in the early history of Northumbria .
     [java] 
     [java] He said he had remained silent about Mr Naqvi being held but would now speak .
     [java] 
     [java] Few in the finance ministry will fret about this .
     [java] 
     [java] Do n't fret about Jonathon , Melanie .
     [java] 
     [java] He stopped fretting about his life and about the future , about what was good or bad in it .
     [java] 
     [java] It ca n't help that he is fretting about possessions when he should be worrying about the state of his marriage .
     [java] 
     [java] Daniel patted his wife again and tried to reassure her , although he was worried himself about Billy 's wellbeing .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Of course I still have a wife , but there 's no need for you to worry your pretty little head about it .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm sure there 's no need to worry yourself about that , missus . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He worries a great deal about the house . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Of course , just as sociologists and poets worry a lot about their actual influence , journalists may often see themselves as hacks and hackettes .
     [java] 
     [java] I never , ever worry about my age .
     [java] 
     [java] His mother had begun to feel very angry about his refusal to eat as he had started to lose weight , which worried her .
     [java] 
     [java] Have you ever felt so angry about men that you 've been moved to write a song about it ?
     [java] 
     [java] He was angry about class , hypocrisy and the establishment .
     [java] 
     [java] Sue gets cross about that .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm real disappointed about the letter .
     [java] 
     [java] I feel very angry and disappointed about the incident . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He said : `` The lads are disappointed about the manager 's ban , but these are the sort of games you come into football for .
     [java] 
     [java] Irishman Mr MacSharry was so furious about Mr Delors ' interference that he resigned his post .
     [java] 
     [java] Not only was he going to be absolutely furious about her being in this police station , but she dreaded having to tell her cousin about it too .
     [java] 
     [java] Thames Valley Police are known to be furious about the case .
     [java] 
     [java] He admits to becoming irritated about Sinead 's continual soul-searching over her family problems .
     [java] 
     [java] Most of the Balkan states were irritated about territory .
     [java] 
     [java] She really was mad about what she 'd just found in her freezer .
     [java] 
     [java] I was mad about her being killed , mad at whoever killed her .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Did n't seem too pleased about something . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The army had n't been too pleased about that little episode either .
     [java] 
     [java] You 're pleased about his engagement -- he told me that some time ago -- and you 've as good as admitted it tonight . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He had n't sounded very pleased about something -- that made two of them .
     [java] 
     [java] `` That creature is a charlatan , '' said Rain , sore about Ruby claiming extra-sensory perception of her visit to Epping Forest .
     [java] 
     [java] Predictably his wife was very upset about his resignation .
     [java] 
     [java] At her Dunblane home last night , she said : `` I am very upset about the story .
     [java] 
     [java] But the majority were either dissatisfied or upset about a number of aspects of the way they had been treated during the assessment process .
     [java] 
     [java] He was upset about the kids .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm very upset about Francis more upset than I can say . ''
     [java] 
     [java] You 've always been very close to them -- in fact , it 's one of the things I envied about you .
     [java] 
     [java] Eldorado just reflects the people who make the programmes , that 's what I hate about it .
     [java] 
     [java] `` What do I like about her ?
     [java] 
     [java] She loved everything about this man , and when he took her she tried to stifle the cry of pain .
     [java] 
     [java] Weeks of legal bickering by Pakistan lawyers have left the International Cricket Council fuming about their inability to take firm action over the damaging saga .
     [java] 
     [java] With a sob , Theda flung her arms about his neck and buried her face in his shoulder .
     [java] 
     [java] It was almost as though some supernatural force possessed him , causing him to shed twenty years ; his face lost much of the sunken look of recent times , and he went about his work with such youthful vigour that a stranger might have believed there were not one but several such figures pushing trolleys about the corridors of Darlington Hall .
     [java] 
     [java] Then it abruptly disappeared , and all he could see were entrancing coloured patterns chasing each other about the glowing darkness like tropical fish .
     [java] 
     [java] When we see pictures in the colour supps of some half-dead , prunelike Hollywood mogul escorting a twenty-year-old blonde bombshell about the place , we do not say , `` Oh I thought he would have gone for somebody more half-dead and prunelike . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He follows me about all day . ''
     [java] 
     [java] 'T is the fly buzzing about the blaze till its wings are scorched .
     [java] 
     [java] I listened to the flies buzzing about me and the murmur of the bees in the clover as they tumbled at our feet .
     [java] 
     [java] You may have seen small single engine aircraft buzzing about the skies on warm sunny mornings .
     [java] 
     [java] Some days , when it 's damp , he has to use the stick inside , too , and I can hear him clacking about the uncarpeted rooms and corridors of the house ; a hollow noise , going from place to place .
     [java] 
     [java] He raised his wings and clattered about his cage , dashing his talons and beak against the bars and wire mesh to make as much noise as possible .
     [java] 
     [java] When she had chosen the least remarkable and staggered downstairs in a pair of high-heeled purple boots the others got their revenge by wheezing about the room in hysterics once more .
     [java] 
     [java] Inwardly seething , she did as she was told , carefully tucking her dressing-gown about her legs .
     [java] 
     [java] Louisa put down the book , crossed to the bed and wrapped an arm about Emilia 's shoulders .
     [java] 
     [java] The others are always barging about the kitchen and the living-room .
     [java] 
     [java] I gave you yesterday the analogy of the home , and now we can imagine Mary bustling about the home with water for washing , for cooking and for cleaning .
     [java] 
     [java] Schramm tried to imagine what it was like , clambering about the Jebel , searching for something that might not exist , in a very black night , with a lethal enemy somewhere in the darkness .
     [java] 
     [java] Her hair looked wonderful as she darted about the stage and she was at her best in the gypsy dance .
     [java] 
     [java] Snow bunting were flitting about the lochan on the walk over to Sgurr a'Mhuilinn .
     [java] 
     [java] Hector , for once restricted to the floor , gave a yelp of greeting and came to frolic about Theda 's feet .
     [java] 
     [java] `` But I came to realise that it 's all very well gambolling about the countryside feeling at one with nature , but people do n't change completely .
     [java] 
     [java] Hector , who had been gambolling about the porch , slunk in behind her , depressed by the angry voices .
     [java] 
     [java] Later , crippled by paralysis , he could only hobble about the streets , before being confined to his room in Brighton .
     [java] 
     [java] How could it be otherwise , when I have an almost tame squirrel that happily hops about the borders when I 'm feeding or digging ?
     [java] 
     [java] Extroverted , quick and full of enthusiasm , she hopped about the carpet without a word of greeting to anyone .
     [java] 
     [java] He hopped about the grass , gnawing one piece after another , eating the green tops along with the slices .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Well , not march about the country with petitions , like those wretched Blanketeers , at all events . ''
     [java] 
     [java] He got to his feet and paced restlessly about the room , then crouched down before her chair .
     [java] 
     [java] Suddenly the penny dropped , and Meredith knew why he 'd been prowling about the airport like an angry lion .
     [java] 
     [java] I could do no more than prowl about him .
     [java] 
     [java] Julia , not wanting to have to think of Anthony any longer , got out of her chair and prowled about the big dark kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] She prowled nervously about the flat and poured another whisky .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Shepherd appeared in my office with my son -- said he 'd found him roaming about the factory .
     [java] 
     [java] Exhausted but high on adrenalin , he would roam about the house unable to sleep .
     [java] 
     [java] Interpretive dancers rushed about the chamber , waving their arms and trying to keep the fruit piled on their headdresses from coming loose .
     [java] 
     [java] Grimsdale 's eldest daughter cleaned the room briefly with a broom and the rest of the children scurried about the house .
     [java] 
     [java] Fishing cobles were scurrying about the Sound like water beetles , black dots on the deep blue .
     [java] 
     [java] It must be the influence of Jekyll and Hyde , which has been strong since John Barrymore grew long teeth and took to scuttling about dark expressionist streets , bashing and killing .
     [java] 
     [java] He seemed bewildered , shuffled about his room yawning and stretching , and only after several minutes of this focused on Wilson at all .
     [java] 
     [java] They skipped about my feet , a flock of lambs
     [java] 
     [java] Arriving at the studio at eight o'clock one morning , Boulting saw Finch staggering about the set drunk .
     [java] 
     [java] He strode about the drawing room restlessly , occasionally hitting the back of a chair with his hand , and she saw how pent-up were his energies .
     [java] 
     [java] He strutted about the office on his flat feet and smiled too much .
     [java] 
     [java] He unlatched his web again and swam about the cockpit , fielding flotsam .
     [java] 
     [java] Her eyes had rarely left his face , although he was now tramping about the room , gesticulating as he talked .
     [java] 
     [java] Each protozoon makes a biassed random walk about the screen .
     [java] 
     [java] Most of them went through the ritual of gazing about them with curious eyes in search of a familiar face among the crowds .
     [java] 
     [java] He cast a glance about him , noting the half-empty spaces of the undercroft , and the faint gleam of light from above-stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] He glanced nervously about him but it was 2. a.m. and Dobson and the other yobs had long gone .
     [java] 
     [java] Tuppe glanced about the place .
     [java] 
     [java] She watched him for several moments , then looked about the large dining-room , trying to fathom the reason for his actions .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Where are we ? '' he asked , peering about him .
     [java] 
     [java] Similarly farmers are more prepared to be indulgent about their employees ' working hours as long as the necessary tasks are carried out efficiently .
     [java] 
     [java] The club was liberal about that sort of thing in the old days apparently .
     [java] 
     [java] Hence there will be an intra-organizational battle about the case for that particular innovation .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Well , we had a fight about something .
     [java] 
     [java] In spite of the recent spat about Government taking a slice off the hill and upland ewe subsidies , farming is an industry deeply indebted to Government .
     [java] 
     [java] The yew had been grown by John Combes in the early 1700s when this house was built , and there had been an altercation about it ; there had also been an altercation about the building .
     [java] 
     [java] It is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place , though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics .
     [java] 
     [java] She resigned finally from the co-operative over a minor political skirmish about which rooms in the shop would be open to men .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Let 's not fight about a few hours . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Work in the Prince 's office at Buckingham Palace came to a halt when Diana confronted her husband-to-be about his proposed gift .
     [java] 
     [java] Angry at being put at such a disadvantage , Shaughnessy twice confronted Aviv about the leak , and twice Aviv denied having had anything to do it .
     [java] 
     [java] She backed me up when there was the great family war about my future .
     [java] 
     [java] She wore her dark hair in plaits about her head .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'll have to try to forget about Anne and get on with life -- but it will be hard . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` I will , '' she promised , and promptly forgot about it until Sarah said during the week , `` That girl Ella that you know , Anne .
     [java] 
     [java] Lucy wished her father would forget about the whole matter and leave it to the police .
     [java] 
     [java] The third party is now commonly known as an expert , usually because he has been chosen for his expertise about the issue between the parties .
     [java] 
     [java] This means you can be quite certain about total success , relative success and failure and , therefore , be in a better position to learn from experience .
     [java] 
     [java] The French , having been victims of German occupation , were much less certain about this policy .
     [java] 
     [java] Akitt was uncertain about the timing of the recovery .
     [java] 
     [java] Management 's need for accountability is not satisfied and doctors are uncertain about the balance between their clinical and managerial roles .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I am uncertain about my future as at the moment it seems we do n't have a manager . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The smooth style of Bryan Gould and the calm air of managerial competence conveyed by John Smith are deemed essential to make southern voters feel confident about the new Labour Party .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm much more confident about my ability and I have learned a lot .
     [java] 
     [java] I feel quite confident about the future . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` I remain confident about my ability to do the business at Premier League level , and suddenly I 've got the chance to prove this self-belief is not misplaced .
     [java] 
     [java] And this means that they are more confident about their work and really feel they are making progress .
     [java] 
     [java] Now I feel very confident about life .
     [java] 
     [java] Miller was confident about his coaching abilities but lacked the management skills needed to run a Premier club .
     [java] 
     [java] I am not sure about the precise details , but I do believe than when Great-Grandfather Tallentire became old and decided to retire he refused to allow his sons to carry on the licence .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Yes , I 'm not sure about abortion . ''
     [java] 
     [java] This did n't give the guy a lot of confidence about his bet , but I do n't think the thought of losing had entered Peter 's head .
     [java] 
     [java] The Australian 's withdrawal from a three year contract immediately shifted a considerable burden back onto Jarvis , but the former England seamer is not lacking in confidence about his prospects .
     [java] 
     [java] Fratter 's ( 1989 ) study indicates that provided practitioners are convinced about the importance of contact , adoptive families may not be too difficult to find .
     [java] 
     [java] `` If we did not feel 100 per cent positive about our ability to fly the plane safely , we would not put it in the air . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Nor could she have said what made her so positive about this assumption that had become a fixture in her head -- unless it was the fact of Silas 's previous near engagement to Doreen .
     [java] 
     [java] I was indeed rather dubious about the whole idea , but we had n't been getting very far and there seemed to be no harm in just finding out some more about it .
     [java] 
     [java] It is certainly good for me physically , though I am a little dubious about its ultimate good .
     [java] 
     [java] He was also dubious about the interview ; he tried to persuade me to settle for interviewing Ortega 's brother , Humberto .
     [java] 
     [java] He felt no such certainty about Russia .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm sure Daddy was far from delighted to see a bottle of whiskey drank in the house , '' Rose was doubtful about the whole idea .
     [java] 
     [java] I am doubtful about the validity of `` torturing the evidence '' : surely , if you torture someone the usual result is that he will speak the truth .
     [java] 
     [java] Corman , who was both producer and director of The Trip , was unsure about Nicholson 's script .
     [java] 
     [java] They were still unsure about what to put on the B-side , and only made a final decision as they travelled to the recording studio on the bus .
     [java] 
     [java] If you are unsure about the adequacy of your daily diet , look at the list of symptoms below .
     [java] 
     [java] Two surveys whose findings are published today show that many voters are unsure about some main planks of Government policy .
     [java] 
     [java] Only periodically does Mr Tebbit seem to have looked to Powell as a politician who could express some of his gnawing doubts about the Heath government .
     [java] 
     [java] The ANC 's elliptical denial that it was `` organisationally implicated '' has done little to calm white people 's doubts about its commitment to the rule of law .
     [java] 
     [java] It may be recalled that Lanfranc 's doubt about the sanctity of Elphege arose from lack of information about the circumstances of his death .
     [java] 
     [java] There 's no doubt about it , curtains that hang beautifully give an elegant finish to a room .
     [java] 
     [java] Enid had sneaked into Maud 's room for a quick conference about Mildred .
     [java] 
     [java] While I admire the saddle-stitching on the suitcase , Karl has moved on to a conference about the length of Gisela 's fringe .
     [java] 
     [java] There is a conference about the collar , then the jacket disappears to reappear worn by Gisela , teamed with white cotton drill cycling shorts .
     [java] 
     [java] Pushing himself with indolent grace away from the door , Rourke came into the room and began to rummage about the shelves beneath the counter .
     [java] 
     [java] After less than a half-hour of sitting alone he would grow restless , scatter his books untidily about the table and disappear outside .
     [java] 
     [java] It is then rotated 90 degrees clockwise about its lowest corner .
     [java] 
     [java] The second rectangle is first imagined as superimposed on the first then moved vertically downwards 1 cm and rotated 45 degrees clockwise about its own top left corner .
     [java] 
     [java] They also contacted Port Vale about Keith Houchen , but the Midlands club were only interested in a part-exchange deal .
     [java] 
     [java] `` So he still has n't contacted Bailey about the hit ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Mr. S. contacted the warehouseman about what had happened .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Someone called about this the other day .
     [java] 
     [java] We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit .
     [java] 
     [java] She 'd been close to panicking when Jeff had phoned her about the Sardinia stint .
     [java] 
     [java] `` My colleague in America phoned yesterday evening about your book . ''
     [java] 
     [java] On top of it all , just at that moment the cleaners phoned about the carpets -- they were going to come in and steam-clean them while the Professor was away -- and while I was speaking to them I saw Dandy go into the study- ''
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] I 'll get our contracts department to ring you about a fee ''
     [java] 
     [java] The Yorkshire Television switchboard in Leeds with its myriad lines had been jammed all day with calls about Hannah .
     [java] 
     [java] Thank you for your calls about what 's up there in my loft .
     [java] 
     [java] Compare that to one day recently when there were more than seventy calls about a schedule change .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The usual catch : did you lie about your criminal record ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] It is not that he lies about them , rather that only a patient and omnivorous prospector would have found the particular treasures which he quotes .
     [java] 
     [java] `` There are n't any lies about Mudhoney -- except for the shit we make up ourselves . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It can only be a reliance on public ignorance that can allow the Foreign Secretary , Douglas Hurd , and other Tories , to spread lies about the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I was just kidding about that .
     [java] 
     [java] And no , I 'm not kidding about the name .
     [java] 
     [java] It may be relevant for the Industrial Tribunal to investigate whether at the time he was dismissed and if not then when thereafter , he knew that he had the right to complain that he had been unfairly dismissed ; in some cases the Tribunal may have to consider whether there has been any misrepresentation about any relevant matter by the employer to the employee .

     [java] 
     [java] Since then he has been busy working on a medical book about brain tumours in a bid to increase public awareness and raise vital funds for research .
     [java] 
     [java] She liked the script about a young couple in the then fashionable Swinging London , but did not feel it was quite right for her .
     [java] 
     [java] At least two lives of Jackson Pollock are also in the works , as is another script about the collector Joseph Duveen .
     [java] 
     [java] In the February issue of The Art Newspaper , you published an entertaining article about expertises .
     [java] 
     [java] But this latter convention has no place in a volume about English local history , or at least none the author has ever discovered .
     [java] 
     [java] The bank had organized everything concerning the various consultants , the share price , and the prospectus -- a forty-page , glossy volume about the company 's structure , trading situation , and future plans .
     [java] 
     [java] He was evasive about Rob too ; almost as if he had n't wanted to talk about him .
     [java] 
     [java] Bob was always evasive about Tessa , which made Jannie suspect that he might be serious about her .
     [java] 
     [java] The lies , omissions , and distortions which used to characterise historical research and teaching have come to an end and , with every day , honesty about the past is capturing more territory .
     [java] 
     [java] The attempt at honesty about Chernobyl had strict limits , and was neither thorough nor consistent ; but it was a break , never mind an incomplete one , with the Soviet past .
     [java] 
     [java] As I write there are a few small , unexcited newspaper reports about the progress of peace talks taking place , under the aegis of ex-President Jimmy Carter , in Atlanta , Georgia .
     [java] 
     [java] The Israeli Peace Now movement condemned the decision , but defence sources said the order was based on detailed reports about Mr Husseini 's political activities .
     [java] 
     [java] There have been reports about an increasing number of people suffering from food poisoning and accusing fingers have been pointed at food manufacturers , distributors , caterers and even consumers .
     [java] 
     [java] Lewis also had to contend with tabloid reports about an off-screen romance between her boyfriend and Geena Davis during the shooting of Thelma Louise .
     [java] 
     [java] More dramatically , in the spring of 1990 , a senior DEA intelligence analyst confirmed that most of what Aviv had said in his report about narcotics trafficking through Frankfurt airport was true .
     [java] 
     [java] Editor , -- There is scarcely an assertion in Richard Smith 's editorial about the General Medical Council ( GMC ) with which I would not take issue .
     [java] 
     [java] One can not be distanced from or emotionally neutral about issues of self-knowledge .
     [java] 
     [java] As with other strong personalities , people were seldom neutral about her .
     [java] 
     [java] Sir Curtis Keeble , former BBC governor , said the disclosures about Mr Birt 's finances should be examined by the corporation 's board .
     [java] 
     [java] Why should Kathleen not visit the nursery garden , why had it been necessary to make the explanation about the geranium plants , why had she flushed with guilt and fear and concealment ?
     [java] 
     [java] She listened uncomprehendingly to Wilcox 's technical explanations about the drag and the cope , core boxes and coffin moulds .
     [java] 
     [java] It offers access to monied and aristocratic lifestyles , it has the atmosphere and tension of auctions , and it judiciously slips in technical explanations about antiques .
     [java] 
     [java] Therefore , all viewers have the right to ask and receive explanations about a station 's programming , contents of programmes and advertising .
     [java] 
     [java] There were sensible , scientific explanations about the effect of the changes in air pressure .
     [java] 
     [java] He was no longer a fearless defender of the cause but a simple German father , scared about his son , needing a shoulder to cry on .
     [java] 
     [java] What many feminists find most surprising about the article is its appearance at a time when the abortion issue has regalvanised women .
     [java] 
     [java] Keith seemed consumed by rage ; he stalked about the house , talking to himself and looking at her occasionally with a red , homicidal fury .
     [java] 
     [java] Here are some of the things the French find funny about Britain : LOLLIPOP LADIES : They find the uniforms hilarious .
     [java] 
     [java] Barrymore reported something interesting about the footprints .
     [java] 
     [java] She was n't mean about it , she was very grateful to have someone to talk to and I used to try to spend a lot of time with her just to cheer her up -- you know , walk the dog with her and go shopping -- just do all the things that would help .
     [java] 
     [java] They chattered and laughed , being rude about Western passersby who could not understand their language .
     [java] 
     [java] In private , politicians from other countries are becoming increasingly rude about Britain .
     [java] 
     [java] As one manager expressed it : '' If you want to move an elephant you have to be pretty rude about it . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` You 're terribly unkind about Colonel Foxton , '' Christabel told her .
     [java] 
     [java] Oliver muttered something unkind about rats and sinking ships but Maurin missed it .
     [java] 
     [java] GERMANS are not often polite about British managers .
     [java] 
     [java] She was polite about the leeks and lumpy cheese and said a similar thing could be done with endives and it looked at first as if the lunch was going to prove a slightly awkward affair .
     [java] 
     [java] He decided to be nice about the whole business , though he still could not see the point of it , and offered to put the little biscuity things into bowls .
     [java] 
     [java] I would even say something nice about his new-fangled haircut if he were to say something hopeful to the London borough of Newham .
     [java] 
     [java] He 'd taken her to church , he 'd taken her to lunch and she had n't been particularly gracious about any of it .
     [java] 
     [java] The conventions about what counts as a convincing argument vary with time and place .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm sorry about that , ma'am .
     [java] 
     [java] I am worried about the partnership , '' says United 's manager .
     [java] 
     [java] She was nervous about her plan now .
     [java] 
     [java] Fleischmann said that one of the referees had said that it was nonsense and that the reaction of this referee had made him nervous about the validity of their experiment .
     [java] 
     [java] I was a bit embarrassed about that .
     [java] 
     [java] They 're a bit embarrassed about us doing their work for them . ''
     [java] 
     [java] They were a little anxious about the flight over the Timor Sea as their compass had been 10d awry on the outward journey though it was correct at Melbourne .
     [java] 
     [java] Many beef farmers in my constituency of Monmouth are deeply anxious about the impact of the MacSharry proposals .
     [java] 
     [java] She 's in a lot of pain , and is extremely anxious about her condition . ''
     [java] 
     [java] And I 'm really excited about it and there 's lots of interest , I think this places are taken up already .
     [java] 
     [java] Carlie and Harvey feel bitter and resentful about the way they 've been treated .
     [java] 
     [java] I coped at the time but now , five years on , I feel guilty and resentful about the whole affair .
     [java] 
     [java] The grand old man of the Scottish mountains , author and TV star Tom Weir , said he was sad about the plan .
     [java] 
     [java] Funny -- I remember that I was more shocked about the child .
     [java] 
     [java] But Beattie is a little apprehensive about the effect of what he has said .
     [java] 
     [java] He went off to the kitchen , leaving Leonora apprehensive about the rest of the evening .
     [java] 
     [java] She in turn had been drawn to him at the time when she was miserable about Jean-Pierre .
     [java] 
     [java] THERE was something particularly touching about the picture of murdered teenager Johanna Young that dominated newspaper front pages this week .
     [java] 
     [java] What is so touching about these poems is the contrast that they express .
     [java] 
     [java] In time , perhaps , she would make efforts to conceal her resentment about his ability to make her feel guilty , and he would make efforts to conceal his anguish about the loss of her .
     [java] 
     [java] By anybody 's reckoning , she still had another week in which to go through agonies about it .
     [java] 
     [java] In Washington there was understanding , but just as much disquiet about British Defence policy .
     [java] 
     [java] We shall find reason for disquiet about this argument .
     [java] 
     [java] But the STUC also voiced disquiet about the way last Monday 's picketing was handled by police , and said it had secured a pledge that policing would now be `` even-handed '' .
     [java] 
     [java] What had once been a largely invisible world of mental hospitals , private suffering , and professional services now appears in local communities as homelessness , strange persons in public , and bewilderment about who is responsible for whom .
     [java] 
     [java] The first important truth for voters in such spirits is that , in their dismay about recent economic and political errors , they are forgetting the immense Tory achievements which preceded them , and are now at risk again .
     [java] 
     [java] His embarrassment about self-disclosure gives the impression , belied by his other books , that he knew nothing of the mystery that grace works by means of human weakness , not by side-stepping it .
     [java] 
     [java] Many solicitors never overcome their own embarrassment about the amount that they charge , though few go on to lower their fees .
     [java] 
     [java] So tell the world , and its boredom about your troubles will heal you .
     [java] 
     [java] Nell 's distress about Black people 's `` ways '' and `` habits '' reaches a climax with the dreaded realisation , `` You 'll have children , Black children ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] We know that the patient who can show distress about their condition , talk about it and share anxiety has a much faster recovery rate than one who suppresses such feelings .
     [java] 
     [java] The media excitement about Enid Blyton and Captain W. E. Johns soon died away .
     [java] 
     [java] They also put Unionists on the defensive , prompting them to make accusations about a republican and Communist conspiracy which stoked fears among their own rank-and-file supporters .
     [java] 
     [java] The old woman might become hysterical again and renew her accusations about Joseph , or she might follow Rain 's own reasoning and link Maurin with the attack at the museum and Sabine Jourdain 's murder .
     [java] 
     [java] `` If you 'd bothered to listen to me , '' Peter went on , `` instead of simply wading in with all those slanderous accusations about her , I 'd have told you earlier . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The Democratic Unionist Leader , the Reverend Ian Paisley , has been suspended from Westminster for five days after refusing to withdraw accusations about Sir Patrick Mayhew .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Maybury was quite scathing about it , but she is a little old-fashioned , and times have changed .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Lamont was scathing about the way the Government conducted its business .
     [java] 
     [java] Now the tory party are forever lecturing us about choice are they not .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The only car apart from a Rolls-Royce that he could fit into was an extra large Range Rover , '' says the driver , who also tells hair-raising tales of ferrying Maxwell about town .
     [java] 
     [java] How could she be concerned about the choice of jam ?
     [java] 
     [java] I am concerned about my seven-year-old son .
     [java] 
     [java] Because they 're concerned about America 's oil dependence , senior government officials have come to rub shoulders with the advocates of conservation and alternative power sources .
     [java] 
     [java] Delighted about Jim , apprehensive for Jasper , Alice lay for a long time awake in the silent room .
     [java] 
     [java] I felt quite depressed about it . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` We tried to encourage the people to work with each other , and talk to politicians , because they argued a lot about what they were going to do all the time , '' he said .
     [java] 
     [java] '' I 'm not standing here all day bickering about this .
     [java] 
     [java] These two treatises gave classic expression to the opposing arguments about the eucharist , and they have been of great interest to theologians ever since .
     [java] 
     [java] Falk advances these principles in the awareness that , pending the actual abolition of nuclear weapons , a different , and much more dangerous conclusion can be drawn from the argument about the illegality of nuclear weapons .
     [java] 
     [java] Arguments about language , in any case , need to be separated from arguments about style , particularly in a period of fast linguistic change , such as the Merovingian Age .
     [java] 
     [java] Even when common goals have been established , conflict may be generated during the planning process because of disagreement about the way in which these goals should be achieved .
     [java] 
     [java] It can do this because during the recent election campaign , there was no great disagreement about economic policy among the parties .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We used to fight about it , when I first knew .
     [java] 
     [java] The fact that they had not fought about it should have announced their despair .
     [java] 
     [java] We 've been fighting about money of late , but then again it might be my face .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Well , sir , it 's not so irrelevant because while he was in that curacy there was some sort of row about a boy in the youth club .
     [java] 
     [java] The protest follows the row about the Chancellor 's $4,700 legal bill paid by the taxpayer , and overspending on his credit card .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a tremendous row about this inside government and Whitehall .
     [java] 
     [java] They 'd probably have a row about it .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a damaging row about the requisition for scrap of his wrought-iron gates .
     [java] 
     [java] Can a row about the endless Saturday afternoons he now spends bent over the bonnet of his old car be used as a vehicle for their underlying struggle ?
     [java] 
     [java] Lord Carrington resigned as Foreign Secretary , pre-empting a distracting row about who was to blame , leaving the Prime Minister unambiguously in charge of policy .
     [java] 
     [java] They 'd probably have a row about it .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Well , sir , it 's not so irrelevant because while he was in that curacy there was some sort of row about a boy in the youth club .
     [java] 
     [java] At one level , Bob and Joan Halton rowed about his old car and his mother .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Parul knew he had been with other women and they rowed about it .
     [java] 
     [java] He did n't support our strikes and we used to row about it , but not now .
     [java] 
     [java] THE recession has lead to record numbers of couples rowing about money problems , says Prudential .
     [java] 
     [java] However , even those who do not doubt the terrible things that happened can still squabble about their meaning .
     [java] 
     [java] He knew Blanche was nervous by her uncharacteristic air of distraction and tried to calm her with compliments about her appearance .
     [java] 
     [java] It was Peters who chided him about his frail physique , which led to his regular attendance at August 's Gymnasium , which was in the basement of Apley Hall .
     [java] 
     [java] Just occasionally the tensions spilled over , such as when she berated Moira publicly about the way she was feeding her first child .
     [java] 
     [java] At no time , either , did Zacco either seek to be alone with him , or utter a word of reproach about his failure with Famagusta .
     [java] 
     [java] The clinical teacher can become knowledgeable about a particular specialty , and will be aware of the demands of the ward .
     [java] 
     [java] When setting up a community leg ulcer clinic , nurses need to be knowledgeable about many aspects of care ( Fig 1 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] I also needed to be knowledgeable about the procedures , likely outcomes and prognosis so that I could give full and accurate explanations to Mrs Allen .
     [java] 
     [java] The Golf Foundation Merit Award Scheme is designed to give young golfers an incentive to improve their technique and also make them more knowledgeable about the Rules and Etiquette .
     [java] 
     [java] The old man was knowledgeable about music .
     [java] 
     [java] She wondered if she should tell him about Amy 's having been a nurse .
     [java] 
     [java] Her last nurses did not tell her about her daughter 's terrible fate .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Nobody told me about this .
     [java] 
     [java] I wo n't ever tell about it .
     [java] 
     [java] She told about the shame , and the heartbreaking decision she was forced to make under duress .
     [java] 
     [java] Doctors should be advised , they must inform patients about side effects and dangers .
     [java] 
     [java] Its purpose will be to inform interested parties about the company 's history , current activities and production facilities , profiles of key employees and financial performance including current position and anticipated future prospects .
     [java] 
     [java] Pineau informed de Gaulle about the strongly republican and socialist trend of resistance ideology and tried to persuade him to abandon his political reticence , which was causing concern among resisters .
     [java] 
     [java] The idea grew out of their weekly meetings and from the desire to inform younger West Indians about their heritage .
     [java] 
     [java] Can you advise me about the pros and cons and tell me the best way to retain their copper finish ?
     [java] 
     [java] A lawyer will be able to advise you about this .
     [java] 
     [java] There will be a brief address about the company and Corby , a video of the process and a visit to the plant .
     [java] 
     [java] Late in 1926 , Herbert returned to South Africa to give lectures about the expedition , illustrated by still photographs and moving pictures .
     [java] 
     [java] Lectures about this type of library material tend to sound like a catalogue of unfamiliar names -- the `` catalogue aria '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Dexter recalled that halfway through the homelessness report Nicola had delivered a short lecture about the appalling conditions in which one family lived while managing to look stunning at the same time .
     [java] 
     [java] `` They would chat about the day , what Alex had been doing -- then Alex would come on the phone .
     [java] 
     [java] On his visit to London we were able to get together for a bit of a jam and a chat about some of the parts he played on the `` new '' album
     [java] 
     [java] Life , she felt vaguely but powerfully , was more than fervent chats about great literature .
     [java] 
     [java] And when the rain threatened to overflow our collective high water mark , we adjourned for coffee and a chat about Neil Kinnock .
     [java] 
     [java] Serious conversation about alcohol is reserved for wine and spirits .
     [java] 
     [java] There was much conversation about the leaves .
     [java] 
     [java] Christopher and Francis were deep in conversation about pottery , speaking French .
     [java] 
     [java] Of course , some people take hobbies , pastimes and other activities to incredible lengths , but you do n't have to be able to converse knowledgeably about all the different types to enjoy an exquisite bloom .
     [java] 
     [java] They spoke about the `` concerns and worries '' President Gorbachev had expressed about the developments in East Germany in recent days .
     [java] 
     [java] They talked a lot about his childhood .
     [java] 
     [java] Well let's talk , let 's talk a little bit about the personnel that you 've got on the City Council now and the kinds of services in general that you 're providing .
     [java] 
     [java] I heard an older couple joking about it : `` I do n't care what kind of burial I have , '' he said , `` as long as I 'm on top of her . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The way they joke about their LP going to 207 `` with an anchor '' , the way they break down the myths of the American Dream and the Troubles back home
     [java] 
     [java] All week long , the Hollywood gossip about this case was of drugs , mysticism and off-beat sex , and for once there may be more truth than fantasy in the flashy talk of the town . ''
     [java] 
     [java] They exchanged banter and gossip about old friends , new acquaintances , and fresh scandals .
     [java] 
     [java] There is without a shadow of doubt some very nasty gossip about me now sludging its filthy way through the intestines of the society I know and have come to despise .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'll tell them malicious gossip about the rest of the club and I 'll become a kind of mascot .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Joe heard the gossip about you and me and this is his revenge . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Father Devine went on to speak of his admiration for Shakespeare , but had no fresh gossip about the Bard .
     [java] 
     [java] Their conversation became more relaxed , drifting from their backgrounds to their jobs to increasingly indiscreet gossip about their colleagues , as the alcohol turned them from new acquaintances into old and trusted friends .
     [java] 
     [java] Moreover there was gossip about the two which disgusted me .

     [java] He lurched forward involuntarily through the entrance , and almost fell at the feet of the chief .
     [java] 
     [java] Lurching through the saloon into her own cabin , she grabbed a sweater from the locker beneath her berth and slammed the cabin door behind her .

     [java] An elderly lady could n't stop crying as the Big Man paced through her small Devonshire village .
     [java] 
     [java] Since you wo n't tell me , I suppose I 'll just have to plod through the whole book . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Burden plodded through the rain from estate agent to estate agent and he at last found Moat Hall , listed in the books of a small firm on the outskirts of the town .
     [java] 
     [java] He was growing more nervous , presumably in anticipation of the sight of the clown , prancing through a doorway or being dragged out by the police .
     [java] 
     [java] She left him to prowl restlessly through the family photographs that were prominently displayed as she first took a shower then dithered over what to wear .

     [java] 
     [java] Thus it was welcomed because it seemed to bring together on the one hand the idealized liberalism of the l960s and 1970s -- when pupils and teachers hoped to romp together through an uninhibited dance of individualized learning , projects , pupil-centred learning-situations , and an end to authoritarian concepts of knowledge -- with , on the other hand , the 1980s demand for `` standards '' .

     [java] As nightmares scampered through Flyte 's imagination , Dean 's impassive face began to blur behind the glass .
     [java] 
     [java] On the other side of the pub , Perry scurries through the door .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Flip over and you 'll find equally impressive tunes from Liberty City and Interceptor patiently waiting to be tried and tested , both estimable club-friendly giants sleepwalking through Deep House style lobbies and thoroughly warranting as much attention as `` Reach Me '' .
     [java] 
     [java] She slunk covertly through the entrance .
     [java] 
     [java] Jean Collona also slunk through the Seventies and underlined a look that will for at least a year separate the old from the young .

     [java] When the superintendent staggered through the front door of the maisonette she did not notice the flashing light on her answerphone .
     [java] 
     [java] The harpsichord began a long lute-stop passage , a new movement , as gentle as rain , the sounds stealing through the house , mysterious , remote-sounding harmonies .
     [java] 
     [java] She could n't see the number from where she was , so she stole through the undergrowth and came up to it from behind .
     [java] 
     [java] Anger a tight constriction in her throat , Gina took a step through the open door , her fingers clutching the key to her room .
     [java] 
     [java] He followed the officer , stepping through the churned mud , towards the concrete steps down into the brigade post , and the presence of the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council .
     [java] 
     [java] Every time I heard the wind rustling in the bushes or rattling the slates I 'd duck down under the covers , thinking of hooded ghosts stomping through the garden -- or through the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] Slave masters strode through the crowds of men and women whipping them if they slowed down or showed any interest in the travellers .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] A stroll through Toronto 's Kensington Market and you 'll discover a harmonious , cosmopolitan blend of sights and sounds .

     [java] The woods were damp and overgrown ; she stumbled through brambles and fallen branches .
     [java] 
     [java] The massive door gave way , and the Russians were upon them , stumbling through the debris , some falling to the defenders ' final volley .
     [java] 
     [java] There are no public bars or outlets for purchasing lager , and the only route for escaping the forces of law and order is a taxing swim through a shark-infested bay .
     [java] 
     [java] There 's even a flying snake , which flattens itself into an aerofoil and swims through the air like flying tagliatelle .
     [java] 
     [java] Soar above glacial peaks and swim underwater through the icy caverns submerged within the Chaos Glacier .

     [java] Dine at the restaurant , traipse through the shops -- laugh at the exhibits .
     [java] 
     [java] As he left that all-too-familiar graveyard and tramped home through the snow , Charles the Cheesemonger must have thought that the century was drawing to an unpropitious end indeed .
     [java] 
     [java] But Venice is a seaport still , and above all these lesser vessels there still tread through the lagoon , as they always have , big ships out of the oceans .
     [java] 
     [java] He relaxed his roly-poly figure in the cart and let his piebald pony , who knew the way home as well as he did , trot ahead through the darkness of the berry-lined road .
     [java] 
     [java] We dropped the others off , and now the big shops would be left behind as we waded through the gloomy streets of Fulham .
     [java] 
     [java] Nathan had not been prepared for the bus trip into and out of the town and the long walk through the snow to a campsite either .
     [java] 
     [java] Take a walk through the town , and you will also find a choice of pub-fare , wine-bars , bistros and take-away restaurants , catering to every taste and with facilities for families .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Wriggling through the crowds , I sidled around the walls , admiring black and white photographs of old men in cloth caps playing fiddles , while children looked on wonderingly .
     [java] 
     [java] It was homeward bound after that and we motored south through Finland 's seemingly endless pine forests , past huge lakes with unpronounceable names and rivers with great rafts of pine logs en-route for the sawmills .
     [java] 
     [java] I rest my head against the bars and gaze through them as into a cage .
     [java] 
     [java] Heather Payne simply listened through the thin wall dividing the houses as her victim panicked .
     [java] 
     [java] I looked through her bright red glasses into her light grey eyes and said , `` Well , so far so good , certainly , but let's not count our -- ''
     [java] 
     [java] The Customs officer tilted his head to one side , observing her through eyes slitted against the smoke .
     [java] 
     [java] She sat opposite him as he leaned back in his seat and observed her through gold-rimmed spectacles , and she still felt uneasy with this man .
     [java] 
     [java] Eventually the story spread that the dictator himself was aboard , observing his subjects through the mirror windows .
     [java] 
     [java] But observed through our telescope ( condition , good ) we see the image of a mosque .
     [java] 
     [java] I saw a bright eye peep through a crack , then she caught me watching , and withdrew .
     [java] 
     [java] Andrew added : `` She smelled smoke through the letterbox and naturally panicked and started banging on the door and shouting .
     [java] 
     [java] Carnelian , spying through the eye-screen from wherever , had immediately begun withdrawing the hydra into the warp of Chaos to save it from extinction .

     [java] 
     [java] Grace stared carefully through the telescope .
     [java] 
     [java] I and the one other passenger viewed the landscape through the grill dividing us from the driver , the mail , bottles of milk and newspapers .
     [java] 
     [java] Noreen heard them through her attic window , bellowing outside Snells ' .
     [java] 
     [java] They heard it through the clatter of their engines , but they could not see its faults .
     [java] 
     [java] They become extra sensitive to tiny vibrations made by sounds and can almost `` hear through their feet '' .
     [java] 
     [java] We have no mental conception of what it is like to perceive the world through antennae .
     [java] 
     [java] The definition can be made more accurate , but not wholly satisfactory by specifying that the other animal must have changed its behaviour because it perceived the signal through its sense organs , and was not physically forced .
     [java] 
     [java] A rainbow is formed from the interaction of pure white sunlight with molecules of moisture in the atmosphere acting as prisms that break up the light into the respective colours perceived through our senses .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I realised that our existence is nothing but a succession of moments perceived through the senses .
     [java] 
     [java] He had set a pressure lamp on the Land-Rover 's hood before leaving the cabin but he could n't see it through the rain .

     [java] Nevertheless , they were in London just before mid-day , following White Cross Street through Cricklegate .
     [java] 
     [java] He had not seen the correspondence about the lines through Denbigh , as his men no longer worked over , nor signed the road to Denbigh .
     [java] 
     [java] Meanwhile , Samsonov 's fully stretched men , spurred on by Jilinski , were pressing northeastward , over exhausting sand tracks through forests and between numerous lakes .

     [java] 
     [java] He stood straight and breathed through his mouth tasting mint coolness .
     [java] 
     [java] Then the movement is reversed : the air inside , now heated , escapes through the same pores whereby it entered , and is replaced by cold air inhaled through the mouth
     [java] 
     [java] I saw them watching your house and I escaped through the back .
     [java] 
     [java] Ascends gradually through woods , up the Valley of Desolation , then over moorland to the crags of Simon 's Seat .
     [java] 
     [java] WATCH out for the jugglers , jesters and minstrels thronging through the courtyards -- and be sure not to miss King Arthur 's colourful Daily Parade , the Royal Falconers and the Marionettes show .

     [java] 
     [java] `` The journey through East Germany was terrible , '' one woman said yesterday .
     [java] 
     [java] Their cold journey through the bitter Essex landscape had been fruitless .
     [java] 
     [java] A few more metres and she was faced with a panorama of colourful flower-beds surrounding a small lake where , as a centre-piece , air bubbled through a series of glass tubes of varying diameter and height to make an eye-catching display .
     [java] 
     [java] He always said 'She gulped again and a tear trickled through the make-up .
     [java] 
     [java] In every case they pictured a pastoral place where streams trickled through lush meadows , waterfalls fell into cool , sparkling pools or the sea gently bathed a sandy beach .
     [java] 
     [java] The folds cascaded through her hands on to her lap .
     [java] 
     [java] The bedroom was dim , full of mist seeping through the windows and the candles spluttered and wavered in the draught .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs. Saunders groaned and she covered her face with her hands and then Olivia saw that tears came oozing through her fingers and her chest inside her nightgown was heaving with heavy sobs .

     [java] 
     [java] And he 's never happier than when he 's falling flying , floating through the air .
     [java] 
     [java] From the bank we could see it floating through the reflected lights like a submerged log .
     [java] 
     [java] It was suddenly quiet in the orchard as the mist floated through the trees .
     [java] 
     [java] It features close-up shots of fox cubs playing in woods near Wilton , bats flying through open windows into laboratories and a mole digging for worms within yards of workmen sinking salt wells at North Tees .

     [java] In response to a frantic waving of arms a few minutes later , I opened up our trusty Seagull motor and chugged round the harbour arm to brave the swell .
     [java] 
     [java] The pick-up truck being screeched round the corner by a masterful hero , the soft drink sipped by the teenage lead actress -- both products paid good money to be there .
     [java] 
     [java] They edged round the road 's bend .

     [java] She darted round and round the tower , running fast but waving her hands .
     [java] 
     [java] As soon as they sight a predator approaching , they swiftly dart round to the far side of a tree-trunk before performing the rigid `` statue '' response .
     [java] 
     [java] The father dashed round his vehicle and came out with a camera .
     [java] 
     [java] Bedu 's rhythmics lessons got us all banging bongos , clashing cymbals , dashing round the gym and holding a rhythm against all comers .
     [java] 
     [java] It is a particularly painful spot to be kicked and I spent some time hopping round the byre and cursing in a fervent whisper .
     [java] 
     [java] Without waiting to find out what it meant , she broke into a trot and hurried on round the next corner .
     [java] 
     [java] Bodie received the message about the sneaky departure of Chrissie and the two children as he was jogging round the block , just after six in the morning .
     [java] 
     [java] And when she tried to interest him in niente acqua , he laughed as he limped round his shelves serving several customers at once and , shrugging his high shoulders , said , `` Non c'e pioggia , non c'e acqua . ''
     [java] 
     [java] As he crept downstairs he could hear weird music floating out from under the door , queer spine-chilling music that reminded him of icebergs and great snowy wastes , and polar bears lumbering round in furthest Greenland .
     [java] 
     [java] Melissa dumped her register and handbag on a chair , marched round the desk and tried the cupboard door .
     [java] 
     [java] Now she stood up and began to march restlessly round the room , swinging her long gun by its handle .
     [java] 
     [java] Suddenly desperate to put a distance between them , Rory jumped down from the stool to pace restlessly round the kitchen like a caged animal , unhappy in its imprisonment .
     [java] 
     [java] Francis dragged himself to his feet and plodded round the bend .
     [java] 
     [java] But , after half an hour prowling round the kitchen , the dog -- Rudy -- came over to me .
     [java] 
     [java] Candy 's blue eyes narrowed suspiciously as she prowled round Rory like a tiny bird of prey inspecting its dinner .
     [java] 
     [java] He looked pale and serious as his eyes scampered round the room until they found the telephone .
     [java] 
     [java] That alone would have been worth the scramble round the cliff path .
     [java] 
     [java] So I skulked round the pub , had a burger and a pint and after embarrasing myself by asking two likely candidates if they were Mark , I shot off .
     [java] 
     [java] And there is no shortage nowadays of people willing to slog round the streets delivering Betterware catalogues to earn a few quid .
     [java] 
     [java] Willi staggered round the end of the car park , puffing , red-faced and sweating in spite of the old wind .
     [java] 
     [java] They stamped round the sofa and did that tricky bit of acrobatics that Sid and Ethel showed us the other night .
     [java] 
     [java] He must have been pleased or he would have been stamping round here by now . ''

     [java] 
     [java] Hey ; you want to take a stroll round the battlements ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Much later that night , coming back from dinner and the theatre , followed by a stroll round Trafalgar Square and Whitehall so Donna could glimpse some of the sights , Alexandra looked up at Matthew 's windows .
     [java] 
     [java] He stumbled round the side of the house , through the flower beds , feeling the windows .
     [java] 
     [java] It is in a constant shimmer of glinting silver movement as the countless small fishes swim round and round the outside of the `` ball '' and disappear into an orifice within it .
     [java] 
     [java] Slowly and carefully I swam round the dark walls of the castle .
     [java] 
     [java] I swam round the boat , looking for Rachel , but both she and Casey were gone .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] American experts on foreign affairs tiptoed round Europe .

     [java] We also have to traipse round the neighbourhood on All Hallows Eve , calling on neighbours , who give our children sweets .

     [java] 
     [java] Procles was using his wits in the sort of intellectual games -- rationalistic interpretations of myths , comparisons of popular military leaders -- which appealed to the Greek and Roman public .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] The conclusions of one other major research was that it had substantial social implication of personal family in community lives so these papers were discussed in great detail .
     [java] 
     [java] The inference of arts teacher curriculum isolation seems unavoidable .
     [java] 
     [java] However , these arguments are not particularly strong , for , if the inference of fault is so great , why not include a requirement of proof of fault , at least at the level of subjective recklessness ?
     [java] 
     [java] Angela Cartwright would learn of his humiliation soon enough .

     [java] 
     [java] The Islamic Party of Great Britain is the invention of politicised white converts .

     [java] Therese , seated opposite Leonie on the other side of the table , was scornful of this kitchen gossip .
     [java] 
     [java] Did he consider her to have no good qualities at all , to be so scornful of her ?
     [java] 
     [java] A possible disadvantage is that , since such offences may lack the stigma of the word `` manslaughter '' , they may tend to underplay the gravity of the behaviour involved .
     [java] 
     [java] Not only was there a stigma of social disgrace which still lingered ; there was also the shadow of fear .
     [java] 
     [java] Furthermore we may appear , by using an epidemiological approach , to have added to the stigma of heroin use by comparing it with a `` disease '' .
     [java] 
     [java] The stigma of disqualification tends to linger on well past the point where offenders have served their official punishment , and they often continue to be excluded from law-abiding society rather than being reintegrated into it .
     [java] 
     [java] Michael Young , in his paradoxically assumed role , quotes approvingly the strictures of Lord James on misguided attempts to generalize an elite education :

     [java]

     [java] It was not licence he wanted ; alas ! not even freedom -- his goal was the forcible enlightenment of mankind .
     [java] 
     [java] The answers that his analysis might produce were not intended for the enlightenment of participants but for the enlightenment of anthropologists .
     [java] 
     [java] And I would think it ' s perhaps rather foolish of Mr Coombes to actually raise this issue .
     [java] 
     [java] The article even invoked the views of John Maynard Keynes as evidence of the foolishness of the government 's approach .
     [java] 
     [java] But with the foolishness of youth , she convinced herself that somehow , somewhere , there was an answer to their problem .

     [java] It was n't very smart of me to upset the guy in the first place .

     [java] The emergence of a new concept does not always indicate the formulation of a new idea .
     [java] 
     [java] It is in effect impossible to eliminate discretion by the formulation of rules ( Hill 1972 , Ch. 4 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'd like to congratulate the officers and the members on the formulation of these decisions .
     [java] 
     [java] It would appear otherwise , at times , due to wording of newspaper articles .

     [java] 
     [java] But he had not asked after her ; unsuspected questioning of her mother had told her that .
     [java] 
     [java] Julia tried to obey , as she tried to do everything he demanded of her over the next few days and as she tried to keep her misery and pain and fear from all of them .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Who , '' he demanded of the matador , much as the Caterpillar of Alice , `` are you ? ''
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] But we were not moved to write about them , possibly because they were so very much themselves , any personal comment of ours might seem an intrusion .
     [java] 
     [java] The nearest we got to an official pronouncement on the recent escalation of terrorism was the inane comment of Security Minister Sir John Wheeler that the IRA was defeated .

     [java] 
     [java] This takes you up over Bwlch-y-Saethau , the Pass of the Arrows , where the battle with Mordred is actually supposed to have taken place .
     [java] 
     [java] In complete contrast , the northern skyline was dominated by the huge granite walls and steep icy gullies of the 23,000 ft Ak Tash massif .
     [java] 
     [java] North thought Reagan might qualify , like Teddy Roosevelt , for the Nobel Peace Prize for ending the Iran-Iraq War , and that Secord was directly in line to get the Medal of Freedom .

     [java] In this More attacked Tyndale 's translation of the New Testament in detail , but did little to clear the clergy of charges of corruption .

     [java] Another portrayed the Infant Jesus smiling , arms outstretched , in the manger at Bethlehem where Christ 's mother stood in a dress of gold and a mantle of deep sky blue .
     [java] 
     [java] She lay quiescent and felt his strong fingers , quicker now , move to unfasten the buttons of her shift one by one .
     [java] 
     [java] Swiftly , she unfastened the small pearl buttons of her bodice , and pulled the dress over her head .
     [java] 
     [java] I put on my clean uniform and adjusted my beret , blousing my trousers over the buckles of my combat boots .

     [java] He rose then as if to go but impulsively Robyn caught at the sleeve of his robe .
     [java] 
     [java] Dot clutched at the cuffs of her coat but even the familiar softness of worn velvet was not reassuring .

     [java] His vest had been sewn to the waist of his undershorts .
     [java] 
     [java] Tommy pulls a shining chrome gun from the waist of his trousers .
     [java] 
     [java] She had long , black hair down to the waist of her tight satin bodice .
     [java] 
     [java] Jill greeted her arrival , completing the notes she was writing before clipping her pen into the pocket of her dress .
     [java] 
     [java] I tilted my head down and tightened the cord on the hood of my jacket .
     [java] 
     [java] It was an old ewe , treading on the skirt of her raincoat , that roused Elisabeth .
     [java] 
     [java] He caught up the skirts of his robe and scurried after them .
     [java] 
     [java] The wave had had its ropes cut and was erupting in an avalanche of fury that would bury everything in its path .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] I cried a torrent of tears .
     [java] 
     [java] She could n't help it ; the words poured out , a torrent of pent-up emotional resentment , released at last .
     [java] 
     [java] A huge torrent of blood streamed from the locket .
     [java] 
     [java] The flood of referrals now reaching health and social services does not , of course , mean that a new evil is stalking the land .
     [java] 
     [java] The flood of tormented flesh appeared to be one single myriad-headed entity which was now compressing itself insanely till eyes started , skin split , till blood vessels sprayed .
     [java] 
     [java] The recent flood of cheery indicators is so good that it almost certainly condemns the beaming government to setbacks over the coming months , and to talk of a double-dip recession .
     [java] 
     [java] The details of this task are entrusted to the Future Legislation Committee of the Cabinet which has to cope with a flood of requests from the various Departments of State who all wish to have their proposals included .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Is it right that liability for the second most heinous crime in English law , which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , should be satisfied by this relatively low grade of fault ?

     [java] 
     [java] AI now opposes house demolition as a governmental punishment of political opponents .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] Priests have always been regarded as healers of the mind , and even their modern equivalents in the psychoanalytic movement are similarly preoccupied with the dreams of their patients .
     [java] 
     [java] Thank you , Lord , that You are the great healer of those who suffer in body , mind or spirit .
     [java] 
     [java] It therefore had only a limited use in the oral short term therapy of urinary tract infections .
     [java] 
     [java] Survivors of sudden cardiac death : a rational approach to evaluation and therapy of patients surviving ventricular fibrillation .
     [java] 
     [java] Such altered viruses can transduce non-replicating cells , including differentiated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and elsewhere , and this has made them the chosen vectors for genetic therapy of cystic fibrosis .
     [java] 
     [java] Equally the long-lived persistence of authoritarian regimes in post-war capitalist societies ( as in Spain , Portugal , Greece , Brazil and Argentina ) reawakened Marxist writers ' interest in explaining `` exceptional '' regimes .

     [java] 
     [java] In policy he was a critic of dear money and an advocate of public works .
     [java] 
     [java] He was a critic of last year 's infantry cuts .
     [java] 
     [java] Critics of Townsend argue that this is a spurious claim inasmuch as it depends on Townsend making very dubious judgements about what the social needs are of which people might be `` deprived '' .
     [java] 
     [java] We now turn to two aspects of Marx 's and Engels 's anthropological theory which are more directly central to their critique of capitalism than those topics discussed so far ; the evolution of labour and property .

     [java] It turns out that despite the accolades of later historians , Davy had formidable competition for the creation of a lamp .
     [java] 
     [java] To someone brought up in the relative austerities of the Church of Scotland , all this gilt and marble , colourful painting and painted statuary seems rather extraordinary and , somehow , secular .

     [java] 
     [java] With estates scattered across the country and freedom from episcopal and royal jurisdiction , its mitred abbot was one of the great barons of England .

     [java] Women drifted in and out of the house and nearby kitchens carrying pasta and salads , clearing plates and replenishing baskets of bread .
     [java] 
     [java] Then she opened the bread drawer of the dresser , took out the bread knife and the oval basket of plaited straw with its red check cotton lining .
     [java] 
     [java] And he brought me these forty baskets of tomatoes this Friday night .
     [java] 
     [java] He hands her a beaker of champagne .
     [java] 
     [java] He told her she was a fool , and wished her luck -- then he gave her a gold sovereign and a bottle of champagne as a farewell present .
     [java] 
     [java] Pain had her in its grip again , but with the help of the black bottles of medicine she was able to conceal the worst of her suffering from her family .

     [java] She took out the tin box of letters and carried it back with her into the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] He brought her a silver bucket of ice cubes with the glimmer of a flourish .
     [java] 
     [java] We buy her a large Coke and an even larger carton of popcorn .
     [java] 
     [java] There was the carton of juice tipped over outside the hide and the paper from the biscuits .
     [java] 
     [java] Cartons of medical supplies were stacked on the dirt floor .

     [java] And here were drums of chemicals , each labelled , each with a job number to check against sampling .
     [java] 
     [java] You do n't have to use ready-made cable lengths ; ; you can buy a drum of thin Ethernet cable ( RG-58/50Ohm ) at about 50p per metre , and make up your own cable lengths .
     [java] 
     [java] Between Mary and the unborn child was a network of expanded muscles and a sealed drum of amniotic fluid , in which it rested , stretched an unfinished limb , rolled and rested .
     [java] 
     [java] Half an hour with a drum of selective weed killer and a spray and you 'd put paid to that lot for good and all . ''
     [java] 
     [java] She went straight to her jug of water and lifted it up by the handle and peered inside .
     [java] 
     [java] She kept handy a jug of filtered boiled water for drinking : this was the only way to avoid the numerous intestinal parasites from which almost all the local people suffered all their lives .
     [java] 
     [java] Soon , the wicker basket was packed with fruit , slices of pork pie , daintily cut sandwiches and a small earthenware jug of sarsaparilla .
     [java] 
     [java] They used to have bread and cheese and a jug of cider under the hedgerow , but I do n't think they even do that any more .

     [java] 
     [java] The conventional wisdom about `` ring and spoke '' road patterns survived , as indicated by the commencement of Birmingham 's inner ring road ( Smallbrook Ringway ) in 1957 .
     [java] 
     [java] She carries under one arm her folder of lecture notes , and under the other a bundle of books from which to read illustrative quotations .

     [java] This is the '70s equivalent of Julia Roberts , Mel Gibson and Vanessa Paradis wrestling in a vat of KY
     [java] 
     [java] Do you think the Ancient World was all rose petals , lute music , and plump vats of honey sealed with bear fat ?
     [java] 
     [java] We can hear that for ourselves in the records that have been issued of Karajan rehearsing the late Mozart symphonies or the Finale of Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony .
     [java] 
     [java] The grand finale of the Powells ' party was always charades .
     [java]

     [java] The moon disappeared , and there was a slow , light wind , like the breath of a dying man , as Gabriel climbed the ladder and started thatching high up on top of the third rick .
     [java] 
     [java] From the darkness of the interior of this well came the smell of burned refuse and decaying meat and the stench of urine .
     [java] 
     [java] Around us was a wilderness of grey dune-sand and Port Jackson willow , and a stench of garbage and ash .
     [java] 
     [java] The stench of urine was added to the other rancid smells of the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Strange , Athelstan thought , how men liked to see their brothers die , yet feared the actual sight and stench of death .
     [java] 
     [java] He was passing the open door , caught the odour of cigarette smoke .
     [java] 
     [java] The bitter stench mingled with the odour of putrescent flesh and he almost retched again but found that there was nothing left to bring up .
     [java] 
     [java] The stink of gasoline filled the air and the Prophet 's eyes widened in shocked disbelief .

     [java] They thumped together into the Range Rover .
     [java] 
     [java] Often we cross the border into Italy .
     [java] 
     [java] Yet of those lines only 10 actually crossed the border into Russian Poland , and even as late as 1918 there was no direct railway link between Poznan and Warsaw .
     [java] 
     [java] Aiming to cross into Austria at Gmund , I came on the border post sooner than I had expected and , misreading the signs , drove past the guard-post to the frontier barrier .
     [java] 
     [java] We now descend a winding road into the village .
     [java] 
     [java] The second real objection to this form of psycho-biography is that as soon as Freud is quoted as gospel , the whole argument descends into music hall burlesque for everybody but dedicated Freudians .
     [java] 
     [java] Then one night the child fell onto the bass drum , plummeting ten feet into the orchestra pit without seeming to harbour a grudge , and it occurred to his father to try bouncing him .
     [java] 
     [java] Only four months previously the land had suddenly plummeted into the straits , taking with it a village of some eighty souls .
     [java] 
     [java] The plane rises unsteadily into the air .
     [java] 
     [java] The track dipped , weaving into a wooded hollow .
     [java] 
     [java] The sharp declivities on all sides give depth to the prospect and reveal Mallerstang below and the Eden valley winding into the distance backed by Cross Fell , with the town of Kirkby Stephen also easily seen .
     [java] 
     [java] In the cold darkness within he groped his way to the narrow stair that wound upwards into the triforium , and climbed it , clinging with nervous hands to the stone .
     [java] 
     [java] It turned out to be a story about the residents of a block of flats being used as breeders by aliens , who implant their offspring into the unsuspecting humans .
     [java] 
     [java] Injected into the brain in high enough doses , such antibiotics will also stop most of the brain 's RNA or protein synthesis for a period of some hours .
     [java] 
     [java] Quickly Robert inserted the needle into the thigh muscle , and in about a minute , the small body went limp .
     [java] 
     [java] Needle insertion into the tender points was avoided in this study .
     [java] 
     [java] The occupants jumped out and began to load packages into a waiting truck .
     [java] 
     [java] Miss Bradley , of Crowthorne , Berks , was stabbed repeatedly in the back with an eight-inch carving or butcher 's knife as she loaded shopping into her car in Acton Town , west London .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , without more ado , he loaded the horses into the trailer .
     [java] 
     [java] Use Extended memory and load smartdrv into Upper Memory Blocks if you 've got EMM386 active as a UMB provider .
     [java] 
     [java] Lowden have managed to pack a big sound into a small package and the end result is a guitar that can cope with anything from basic stage accompaniment to virtuoso-standard fingerpicking .
     [java] 
     [java] The robbers opened the strongroom and packed the cash into bags .
     [java] 
     [java] She began gathering plates and cutlery , then packed them into their hampers while the two guides dismantled the barbecue .
     [java] 
     [java] The following companies are featured in a short season that packs sixteen events into three days .
     [java] 
     [java] She had piled her long hair into a sleek chignon , and tiny wisps escaped across her brow and to the nape of her neck .
     [java] 
     [java] With City struggling to defend at set pieces , Strachan again planted a free kick into the penalty area where David Wetherall released Gary Speed whose left foot shot gave Tony Coton no chance .
     [java] 
     [java] Culliman chuckled at the idea ; the Ambassador murmured something and backed into the room .
     [java] 
     [java] The other man backed into the shadows of the doorway .
     [java] 
     [java] `` So you just barge into my bedroom and wake me up ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] He gets a bit fussed and fidgety if I barge into his bedroom but we sometimes have these little chats on the stairs now .
     [java] 
     [java] The man was having a family gathering when the masked raiders , armed with a pistol and a knife , barged into his home in Knowle , Bristol .
     [java] 
     [java] At that moment James Morris barged into the office without knocking , looking flustered .
     [java] 
     [java] Hearing these words and seeing the speaker ride boldly toward him , the tiger was so alarmed that he turned tail and bolted into the forest .
     [java] 
     [java] Indian journalists are busily burrowing into the business affairs of the prime minister 's family , and there are signs they might find something embarrassing .
     [java] 
     [java] Instead of burrowing into the foliage it makes its home in the stems of aquatic plants .
     [java] 
     [java] We clambered into the back of a VW truck and drove for about five minutes , then waited outside an apartment block while the guards chatted with a woman .
     [java] 
     [java] The end of the show was a slow fade as Joyce dances into a kind of immortality after her death from cancer in 1979 .
     [java] 
     [java] Growing bolder , she made a dash into the hollow of his mouth , and touched his teeth , played briefly with his tongue , before darting back out .
     [java] 
     [java] '' He flitted into the parlour as his wife made a threatening gesture .
     [java] 
     [java] She flounces into the living room and holds open the door .
     [java] 
     [java] They hastened into the shelter of rocks and wood , wary of falling branches but aware that they had little choice but to seek refuge from the storm in the wind-shadow of great trees .
     [java] 
     [java] AMERICAN Civil War fanatic Ray Loveslife-Brown will hobble into his next `` battle '' on crutches -- after blowing off a toe with his musket .
     [java] 
     [java] Hobbling into Range West on crutches , with a rope round my shoulders , I was looking forward to the expressions of disbelief that would have greeted my reply to sentries ' questions about what I was doing .
     [java] 
     [java] As a fledgling journalist on the Yorkshire Evening Post I had written one or two bits and pieces about my jaunts into the Dales .
     [java] 
     [java] Watching the other girl jog into the distance , Lindsey hesitated fractionally before deciding that she might as well go for a swim anyway .
     [java] 
     [java] Four hours late , the train limped into Winnipeg at midnight .
     [java] 
     [java] Initially he saw only one of the hideous creatures , but more of the demons appeared out of the darkness , loping into the alley .
     [java] 
     [java] Dexter came off the phone and scribbled a line or two of notes when Blanche loped into the office .
     [java] 
     [java] As he loped silently into his new position , Doyle wondered if Chrissie Stone knew what her husband was up to .
     [java] 
     [java] Cardiff threw himself backwards against the staircase wall , as the thing from the stairwell lunged backwards into the darkness , taking the flapping and gutted body of Peters with it , still fastened to its arm .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Failing that , '' he said pragmatically , `` shall we meander into a cafe for something to drink ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] At any time of the year , if you meander into the hilltowns , your senses will be rewarded .
     [java] 
     [java] She padded into the galley .
     [java] 
     [java] The back screen door slammed and a second later her son Hank padded silently into the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] Everton , inspired throughout by Peter Beardsley , killed off the game by romping into a 3-0 lead in 38 minutes and could easily have doubled it .
     [java] 
     [java] Clarissa closed hers quickly and scrambled into some clothes .
     [java] 
     [java] He scurried into the safety of the great car .
     [java] 
     [java] They looked about them a bit hazily and then at the bleeding half-thing that had been the young boy and scuttled into a corner .
     [java] 
     [java] She scuttles into the house at twenty past four , and then she floats down the stairs as Stephen comes in the door .
     [java] 
     [java] I saw the outlandish figure shuffling into the dock .
     [java] 
     [java] Preceded by a cloud of vaporised breath , a figure shuffled into the light spilling from the Hall .
     [java] 
     [java] The warriors now form a line and skip into the enclosure .
     [java] 
     [java] At this moment Badger skulked into the kitchen , loped over to the pedal bin , and stood gazing mournfully at a piece of orange peel , just visible over the edge of the plastic rim .
     [java] 
     [java] U From my vantage point I could see through the railings into the front garden where Shep was slinking noiselessly into position beneath the stones .
     [java] 
     [java] And are you happy with your pointlessly expensive urban house with its coffee-and-cream decor and its bristling gadgets , your sixty-five-minute slog into work every day , your overheated office with the 'phone shrilling in your ear , your tiresomely predictable holidays , your interests in food , jogging and American films of the 1940s , your car which is always getting scratched , and your kids and the mortgage and the bills and all that ?
     [java] 
     [java] The shafts sprang into the air and I was dangled like a gymnast on parallel bars , before being tossed to the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] Raul Boesel , a Brazilian , sprinted into an early lead as the field tested the narrow corners .
     [java] 
     [java] Claire sprints into work .
     [java] 
     [java] We miss the headlines , staggering into the back of the television lounge about five minutes after the news starts .
     [java] 
     [java] He had just paid for the whisky when the door blew open , and a huge Irishman staggered into the establishment .
     [java] 
     [java] Weary beyond belief , we kept tramping on , stamping our feet into the soft desert sand and lifting them up again like automata , every step an effort .
     [java] 
     [java] She grew bolder and stole a wee bit further into the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] But as the pony trotted on under the cloud-filled November sky the voice that soon stole into Abie Klugman 's mind was not from his past or his future , but from his present .
     [java] 
     [java] She frowned , not understanding at first , then felt a faint flush steal into her cheeks as his meaning became clear .
     [java] 
     [java] Never would he forget the walk home along the promenade afterwards when her delicate little hand , albeit gloved , stole into his .
     [java] 
     [java] A flush stole into Lucy 's cheeks as she snapped coldly , `` In that case , better luck next time . ''
     [java] 
     [java] In the foreground , blue water tumbled beside the steps into rectangular pools .
     [java] 
     [java] Perhaps the Thunderbird 's one-sided peghead might have been more in keeping with Gibson 's bold step into the next century .
     [java] 
     [java] Chant went off , and Estabrook climbed the steps into the caravan .
     [java] 
     [java] These steps into a wider world were part of a great process of expansion by western Europe that had already been going on for decades .
     [java] 
     [java] She stepped into the garden uncertainly , followed by two tall people .
     [java] 
     [java] Anthea has only just stepped into Yvette 's shoes but has already made pals with the other presenters and , course , Bonnie the dog .
     [java] 
     [java] Kevin looked furious as he stomped into his office .
     [java] 
     [java] Oliver 's beach friends straggled into the cafe , grumbling at the abrupt change of weather .
     [java] 
     [java] He strode briskly into the building as if nothing had happened .
     [java] 
     [java] Barnett threw the door open and strode into the street .
     [java] 
     [java] Claudel strolled into the market , rubbing shoulders , ignoring and being ignored .
     [java] 
     [java] Blinded by the chlorine , he had stumbled into a house that was burning after being hit by a shell .
     [java] 
     [java] If can recall to this day a book I had for review years and years ago in which the hero swaggered into a smart London nightclub , ordered a magnum of champagne and drank it down .
     [java] 
     [java] If another stickleback swims into a male 's territory , the owner swims hard at the intruder , and drives it off .
     [java] 
     [java] Ludens tiptoed into the kitchen and was amazed to see two mugs on the table with remnants of tea in them .
     [java] 
     [java] Frowning , O'Hara inched open the pass door and tiptoed into the prop-room .
     [java] 
     [java] VALERY and Ina and their children were visibly tired as they traipsed into the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption reception hall at Ben Gurion Airport .
     [java] 
     [java] `` If I tread too presumptuously into sacred places , reprove me , '' entreated the earl , with the submissive sweetness of a brand-new novice .
     [java] 
     [java] Between 1919 and 1923 about 700,000 Germans living just inside the Polish border , in Poznania and the Corridor were forced to abandon their homes and trek west into the Reich .
     [java] 
     [java] They trekked into the mountainous countryside in Southern Arabia for what turned out to be a memorable day .
     [java] 
     [java] He longed for rest but knew that he had to keep moving , and hauling on the line , he got his hands on to the taffrail and vaulted into the cockpit .
     [java] 
     [java] He 'd gladly wade into the attack .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm not used to some bloody apprentice waltzing into my house and asking me about my private affairs -- ''
     [java] 
     [java] Once again The Smiths waltzed into a situation far in advance of their short-lived career .
     [java] 
     [java] Once inside she wriggled into the corner of the seat to make room for him , and prepared to enjoy the novelty .
     [java] 
     [java] Johnson then insisted on descending to the shore and boating into the basin itself , which was entered by means of vigorous rowing to the very entrance , then , oars shipped , by Gliding the rest of the way , as the extended oars would not squeeze through the opening -- although they might today , after two centuries of further erosion .
     [java] 
     [java] At that moment Yanto notices Herbie Connors cycle into the yard with his bag of empties .
     [java] 
     [java] It was the excuse for her deep delaying gaze into the looking-glass .
     [java] 
     [java] Mildred gave one last , long look into Maud 's eyes , but she could see that there was no hope of Maud recognizing a half-mad frog as her best friend .
     [java] 
     [java] She places her hands on my cheeks and stares into my eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] The white woman stared into her wine-glass as her friend started speaking .
     [java] 
     [java] `` You could n't see into the office from the kitchen ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] With extreme tact and gentleness , Aunt Tossie persuaded Mrs Geary into an Old People 's Home .
     [java] 
     [java] She heard John looking for a clean pair of dungarees , heard him persuading Ben into them .
     [java] 
     [java] It will help policemen and insurance assessors to extract sensible evidence from befuddled witnesses , tease effective instructions out of skilled but inarticulate craftsmen , and trick unwary criminals into much completer confessions than they had intended .
     [java] 
     [java] It was a statement of fact , one which again damned her , implying , as it did , that she had been the one to manipulate Peter into a liaison .
     [java] 
     [java] `` -- and culminated in your attempt to blackmail her into a deal .
     [java] 
     [java] The two long fluorescent tubes suspended from the ceiling blinked , then glimmered , then glowed into steady light .
     [java] 
     [java] Edmund Blunden observes that Leapor has modelled her poem on Philips 's , `` but the imitation glows into originality when she comes to close quarters with her subject . ''
     [java] 
     [java] What was more painful were Kate 's fists smacking into his stomach , blow after blow .
     [java] 
     [java] She laughed hysterically , jamming her fingers into her mouth to muffle the sound .
     [java] 
     [java] I smiled at her , and she jammed a copy of Pravda into my hand , her smile still ticking over .
     [java] 
     [java] do n't rub snow into any part of you
     [java] 
     [java] I 've been asleep , lulled by competent hands rubbing aromatic oils into my aching shoulderblades .
     [java] 
     [java] He spat , and rubbed it into the cobbles with his boot .
     [java] 
     [java] Tempera is the normal alternative to oil for overpainting gold , but you may be able to use a thin layer of tempera or even saliva rubbed into the surface as a preparation for acrylics .
     [java] 
     [java] David , aged nine , empties our bin in the yard to pick out the salvageable items before he crams the rest into a sack to take to the dump .
     [java] 
     [java] She handed him sandwiches , which he crammed into his mouth , choking .
     [java] 
     [java] After removing rollers , fingers were used to loosen curls into ringlets .
     [java] 
     [java] Such devaluations were reportedly made to retain competitiveness with the heavily devalued Argentinian austral [ see p. 37244 ] in order to stem the flow of contraband into the country .
     [java] 
     [java] Wilkie wriggled into the seat beside her .
     [java] 
     [java] She bolted into a deep brake of ferns and , bending low , crept away and then sank down and crouched motionless , hoping the two men would n't find her .
     [java] 
     [java] We exited into a back alley via the fire door .
     [java] 
     [java] Penry ushered her into the kitchen , unzipping her jacket as though she were a child .
     [java] 
     [java] The best example of this was the way in which she stung the Government into action to do something about AIDS .
     [java] 
     [java] She was still shaken that anyone should calmly kiss her when she had not been long widowed , but his remark stung her into retort .
     [java] 
     [java] Cadfael began to prowl uphill along the edge of the path , probing into the bushes , and then downhill again on the opposite side .
     [java] 
     [java] In Committee we shall probe deeply into that issue .
     [java] 
     [java] He hauled the harmonium into the room past Mum , pausing only to wink at me .
     [java] 
     [java] As he finished tying the cravat into an acceptable knot he saw that one of the cheese-knives had stuck to the table linen by virtue of the butter that had been left on it .
     [java] 
     [java] Michael and Edward placed one of the flat pieces of steel at one end and Tom and Mr Fletcher fixed it into place .
     [java] 
     [java] Peach alone was in the house , having let himself in through the cat flap Stephen had fixed into the lower panel of the back door .
     [java] 
     [java] Ratagan asked her quietly , slicing into his cheese .
     [java] 
     [java] Time Was Away displays Minton 's striking ability to blend all the parts into a decorative whole .
     [java] 
     [java] They rattled as she stalked , sometimes alarming her prey , and so she scattered them into the sand , to be ingested by the things that lived below the dunes .
     [java] 
     [java] The route concludes with a descent into Borrowdale which is often claimed to be the most beautiful valley in the whole of England .
     [java] 
     [java] He closed the throttle for a descent into Waddington .
     [java] 
     [java] To get the best shots of the Falcon 's descent into an American football stadium Steve set up cameras inside the Hercules plane and attached to the freefallers themselves before positioning himself on the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] One must imagine five or six hundred soldiers swarming into the Garden of Gethsemane .
     [java] 
     [java] Overhead , Soviet troops swarmed into the Reichstag , but at the bunker , all that remained was Hitler 's charred corpse .
     [java] 
     [java] She thought of the bleak , futuristic decor and the grey river beneath , and nodded abruptly before other thoughts could crowd unbidden into her head and start that agonised melting all over again .
     [java] 
     [java] Letters of thanks have been flooding into our offices .
     [java] 
     [java] Dr Glyn Vale , of the Rekomitjie research station in northern Zimbabwe 's valley , claims that the ecologists lack the evidence to prove that the tsetse has prevented farmers from flooding into treasured wildlife areas .
     [java] 
     [java] Men flocked into her office .
     [java] 
     [java] Children type their stories into the computer or microwriter .
     [java] 
     [java] The patient pulls the sweater over his head and then puts the unaffected arm into its sleeve .
     [java] 
     [java] Grass , which is sown with clover , provides rich pasture for cattle in summer and the clover is another plant which puts nitrogen into the soil .
     [java] 
     [java] Put into a deep frying pan with about 3 in water and bring to the boil .
     [java] 
     [java] Hence the importance of repentance , faith , baptism into the messianic community , and the reception of God 's offer of forgiveness and the Holy Spirit .
     [java] 
     [java] With the advent of the Portuguese , Brazil was declared Roman Catholic and according to the practice of the age , Jesuit priests accompanied the occupation of the country , seeking to baptise the indigenous Indian communities into the Catholic faith .
     [java] 
     [java] I was running along the pavement of Rochdale Road , just after midnight , wearing , among other things , two quilted anoraks , one of which had fourteen pounds of sand sewn into the lining .
     [java] 
     [java] `` If you only snore on your back , '' he advises , `` then a tennis ball sewn into your pyjamas may do the trick . ''
     [java] 
     [java] It smacked savagely into the man 's face , flattening his nose .
     [java] 
     [java] What was more painful were Kate 's fists smacking into his stomach , blow after blow .
     [java] 
     [java] Then the police car had crashed into a fence .
     [java] 
     [java] The truck then ploughed into the crowd .
     [java] 
     [java] The young man , who is now 23 years old , was only 16 when a car ploughed into him and a couple of friends as they walked home from a party .
     [java] 
     [java] Several other humans banged into him , almost jarring Masklin loose .
     [java] 
     [java] I witnessed an accident where a vehicle collided into the back of another one , pushing it completely across the crossing .
     [java] 
     [java] The truck smashed into the barrier , broke through it , lurched down an embankment .
     [java] 
     [java] A PASSENGER train smashed into a truck on a level crossing near Lisbon killing the train driver and injuring about 30 passengers .
     [java] 
     [java] Tanjug also claimed 36 children were among those killed at the weekend and police fired into the bodies of the wounded .
     [java] 
     [java] As horrified guests dived for cover , the gang of five fired into the crowd , killing two white couples , before escaping .
     [java] 
     [java] Whatever decorative covering had concealed the entrance had likewise rotted into dust .
     [java] 
     [java] He hooked a finger into the corner of his mouth , as though he was versifying on the spot .
     [java] 
     [java] They journeyed into the countryside , sleeping under the trees , eating what Ivan could trap or shoot .
     [java] 
     [java] On the programme , she commented that her excursions into the world of night give her some very special insights and material which she is then able to use in her novels .
     [java] 
     [java] The rooms inside were stuffed with the loot from Francis 's expeditions into Italy ; tapestries , more statues , gold and silver artefacts , jewelled vases , and the softest carpets of pure wool in various hues .
     [java] 
     [java] Corbett crumpled the parchment into a ball and threw it angrily at the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] A drop of soap trickled into his eyes and he rubbed it only to find that he had created more pain .
     [java] 
     [java] Suddenly a Hurricane came down in a screaming dive and splashed into the sea .
     [java] 
     [java] The crimson rivulets were lengthening , tracing lines down his throat and soaking into the collar of his overalls .
     [java] 
     [java] A TEENAGER who plunged a screwdriver into a frail 85-year-old woman as accomplices ransacked her home , has been sentenced to eight years '' detention .
     [java] 
     [java] Another sufferer plunged her face into cold water for relief .
     [java] 
     [java] As always he had to fight the impulse to fasten his mouth over hers and begin resuscitation , to plunge a needle into the still warm heart .
     [java] 
     [java] William claimed that Richard cheated by plunging his sword into William 's horse when he found that he could not win by fair means .
     [java] 
     [java] We proceed into the bedroom .
     [java] 
     [java] I hurried down the stairs and was in time to see the gentlemen proceeding into the smoking room .
     [java] 
     [java] He sidled into the reception cubby and addressed his receptionist , an eerily svelte woman-form of perfect shape and minimal , pixie-like features .
     [java] 
     [java] I sidled into the room , scarcely daring to breathe lest I harm the recording .
     [java] 
     [java] He sidled into the utility room , treading with remembered caution , and reached for the light switch .
     [java] 
     [java] An opportunity for escape occurred shortly afterwards when she and Wordsworth set off on a walking tour into the Wye Valley .
     [java] 
     [java] Once cold , grind the praline into a fine powder .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] In February US military advisers had accompanied the Liberian troops in operations in Nimba , ostensibly to monitor the Army 's behaviour .
     [java] 
     [java] She accompanied him in the ambulance to Hollywood Memorial Hospital and stayed at his bedside in the intensive care unit as he had a series of brain scans .
     [java] 
     [java] He was escorting three German prisoners in the direction of Brigade H.Q The Germans were doubling along , their hands held high in the air , a look of apprehension on their faces .
     [java] 
     [java] And did n't he desert her in the same heartless way ?
     [java] 
     [java] Furthermore , mutinies and desertions in the forces led to soldiers of the different nationalities returning home to offer their armed support for national administrations .
     [java] 
     [java] The Daleks have surrounded the TARDIS , so the time-travellers are forced to make their escape in the space yacht belonging to Mavic Chen .
     [java] 
     [java] The men made their escape in Munn 's car , which he had reported stolen earlier that day , but witnesses contacted police with the registration number .
     [java] 
     [java] He reached out to touch a hand to the elaborate topknot , but she dodged away , retreating in haste along the counter , her face flaming at the scathing glitter in his eyes .
     [java] 
     [java] The subject never came up when our paths crossed in Sydney three years ago , did it ?
     [java] 
     [java] As the guests left in a state of alcoholic haze , two policemen stood at the door .
     [java] 
     [java] Certainly , it was quite a strenuous walk -- though I can say it failed to cause me any real difficulty -- the path rising in zigzags up the hillside for a hundred yards or so .
     [java] 
     [java] Revving fast in low gear the Citron swerved in a half-circle and smashed into the bank at the roadside , flinging the coolie clear .
     [java] 
     [java] She was about to veer in a different direction when she felt an arm like steel round her waist .
     [java] 
     [java] Some do so secretively , creeping in quietly among the swarm of busy workers , quickly depositing an egg in a waxen cell alongside those belonging to the builders and slipping out again unremarked .
     [java] 
     [java] Only the young Swede and the attendant took a sympathetic interest and pointed helpfully as I gathered up the meatballs and deposited them in the ashtray .
     [java] 
     [java] A micro-second after he saw the first flash , the bullet which had come from it was embedding itself in his skull .
     [java] 
     [java] Probably the most important aspect of this add-in is that it enables you to embed live graphs in your worksheet .
     [java] 
     [java] Water , the original substance which God created when he made the world , represents change , and immersing oneself in a natural body of water is the only way of changing one 's spiritual identity .
     [java] 
     [java] I found that if I immersed myself in what I was doing , the people respected my work and usually kept quiet , aware of my concentration .
     [java] 
     [java] This they immersed in a solution containing pyrole ( a five membered organic ring molecule containing one nitrogen atom ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Sections were dewaxed in toluene , dehydrated in ethanol , washed in PBS , and immersed in a solution of 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity .
     [java] 
     [java] There were ways , Karr had said , of making a man think he 'd done something he had n't : ways of implanting false memories in the mind .
     [java] 
     [java] Zimbabwe has begun an experimental scheme to track its remaining rhino by the use of transponders implanted in the animals ' skin .
     [java] 
     [java] His hand shook a little as he inserted the key in the lock .
     [java] 
     [java] Beacon fires are a particularly vivid parallel with the technique of moxibustion , where needles are heated by small fires before insertion in the body .
     [java] 
     [java] '' And she brought forth her first-born child , and laid him in a manger , because there was no place for them in the inn . ''
     [java] 
     [java] His tip is to lift some mint roots now and lay them in boxes of garden soil or the contents of old Gro-bags .
     [java] 
     [java] The only moment of danger was as she laid him in his cot again .
     [java] 
     [java] Downstairs , the old man gathered together the piles of coins and laid them in the tin chest .
     [java] 
     [java] There are certain errors inherent with a Compass System mounted in an aircraft .
     [java] 
     [java] The slides were then air dried and mounted in glycerine jelly .
     [java] 
     [java] Pack everything in a box , and keep it somewhere accessible -- ideally near the fusebox .
     [java] 
     [java] Behind them , housewives now pack .38s in Gucci handbags , learn to train Rottweilers in close attack work and sign up with security firms such as Armed Response .
     [java] 
     [java] They were glad to see it , as they had packed some food in one of the suitcases , and directly the porter had gone they set about preparing a meal .
     [java] 
     [java] He would then pack them in wooden barrels , till he had a truck load , and then would send them direct from Plowden Station to the dye works where they were used .
     [java] 
     [java] He parked the car in the shade of a nearby tree , then cut the engine .
     [java] 
     [java] Yanto parked the bike in the small alley which separated his Mother 's cottage from the Post Office and stood back to admire the machine again .
     [java] 
     [java] He oversees a water tank parked in the road .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a pile of logs and some firelighters and paper in a large basket in the hearth , and Preston started to pile them in the grate while she continued her explorations in the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] Which is why I 'm placing Marshal Tolonen in charge . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Shape the dough and place in the tin .
     [java] 
     [java] The third or professional year is spent on placement in selected sectors of the hospitality industry .
     [java] 
     [java] The parents believed , however , that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views .
     [java] 
     [java] This planted the seed in his mind that perhaps the work of a record producer could be interesting .
     [java] 
     [java] He had positioned himself in a narrow doorway , in the vain hope it would provide him with some shelter from the biting cold .
     [java] 
     [java] Research can help a company to position its product in the market .
     [java] 
     [java] Their summer holidays are spent in the caravan they have positioned in the yard
     [java] 
     [java] `` Later , '' he said , resting his cigar carefully in an ashtray .
     [java] 
     [java] She put her elbows on the desk and rested her head in her hands .
     [java] 
     [java] finally they allow us to situate the different thresholds in their respective place : for nothing proves in advance that their chronology is the same for all types of discourse
     [java] 
     [java] I 'd appreciate it very much if you 'd stash the gear in the box and get the boat started up . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Melissa stowed her purchases in her shopping bag and picked up her change .
     [java] 
     [java] He gave them some thought , then extracted two and stowed them in his hip pocket .
     [java] 
     [java] Sleep-drugged figures stumble quietly around their bivouacs , feeling for the last few items of rain-sodden kit to stow in their bergens .
     [java] 
     [java] She closed her eyes and stuffed her fingers in her ears .
     [java] 
     [java] He stuffed extra grenades in his pockets .
     [java] 
     [java] He dropped the mercenary sword , tucked his axe in his belt and then strode over the cobbles to the unconscious girl .
     [java] 
     [java] The descendants of Lingulella , slightly larger and called Lingula , are found today in , among other places , the coastal waters of Japan , burrowing in the sand and mud of estuaries .
     [java] 
     [java] Then you hop in the back to keep the dogs company for me . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` Bob 's jogging in Hyde Park .
     [java] 
     [java] He groped his way back to the last junction and limped in the other direction .
     [java] 
     [java] Down below , through thick double-glazing , red buses lumbered in uncanny silence round Darnley town centre .
     [java] 
     [java] His confident , curving serve whistled over the net into the far corner of the court , leaving Murray to lunge futilely in its direction .
     [java] 
     [java] The Jet Ranger arced upwards , a big prehistoric pterodactyl lurching blindly in its death throes .
     [java] 
     [java] The Secretary of State may also prohibit any march in any area , or impose a blanket ban on all marches or a particular category of marches , for a period of 12 months .
     [java] 
     [java] After the official Red Square parade there were two unofficial marches in Moscow , sanctioned by the city soviet .
     [java] 
     [java] But this did n't deter Sam at all , and three days later he was pacing in the kitchen while Letty Carew and Jane Polwhele assisted his wife in the delivery of a daughter .
     [java] 
     [java] Frankie watched her now with a mixture of awe and delight as she pranced in little pirouettes around the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] And then a log broke in the hearth , sending sparks cascading , and the shadows leapt , and Grainne remembered all of the old stories , and could almost have believed that the ancient Ireland had awoken at last ; that goblins and satyrs and cloven-hoofed , pointed-eared creatures were prancing in the room with them .
     [java] 
     [java] Captain Delvert , appraising in April 1916 the crowds of gorgeous well-dressed women who promenaded in the Bois de Boulogne on the arms of their escorts , was reminded of
     [java] 
     [java] Larger numbers of roe deer live near there and Czechoslovakia still has bears and wolves roaming in the wild .
     [java] 
     [java] A former brothel owner testified that she provided girls to romp in a hot tub with Vernon board members at the beach house .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It happened a long time ago , my dear , when we were quite small , romping in the wood .
     [java] 
     [java] Run ! '' the officer ordered , and we all rushed in that direction .
     [java] 
     [java] Out it all rushed in a torrent , the whole story so far .
     [java] 
     [java] Inexorably Rose moved on through the entremets and coffee , sending eight people scurrying in all directions as he masterminded the performance , the objects of which were far from clear to Auguste .
     [java] 
     [java] She skipped in circles round the silent chamber , her great head bobbing like a bird 's .
     [java] 
     [java] He saw the occasional pheasant and partridge winging rapidly away beneath him , or skulking in the brown grass and bracken .
     [java] 
     [java] In the kitchen , Stephanie struggled with the turkey , bloated and slithering in its fatty dish .
     [java] 
     [java] Here in Langdale an ewe stood weakly , blood still damp on its haunches as its offspring staggered in the shock of birth , cord still trailing in the grass .
     [java] 
     [java] Stephenson roared and howled with laughter , slapping his thigh and stamping in the mud .
     [java] 
     [java] And Helmut liked to feel he was stepping in the footprints of celebrated men .
     [java] 
     [java] We were taking a stroll in the garden ; I forgot to mention that . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Delighted to have her company , Harry linked his arm through hers and they strolled in a leisurely fashion down the shady drive .
     [java] 
     [java] Wait a few days till dumbo gets bored and strolls in the streets .
     [java] 
     [java] The spectacle that confronted him was so overwhelming that he all but stumbled in alarm before the policeman caught and steadied him .
     [java] 
     [java] I ran after him , stumbling in the red dust .
     [java] 
     [java] The exhausting discipline , which features a mile and a half swim in open water and a 40-kilometre cycle topped off with a 10-kilometre road race , is one of the fastest growing sports in Europe .
     [java] 
     [java] Even if the male is not ready to spawn and chases him away , She swims in this fashion while being pursued , and returns to her chosen mate as soon as possible .
     [java] 
     [java] I can swim quite well in the pool if I want to . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The Tyne was heavily polluted , from about Prudhoe down to the sea , but after rain , salmon swam upstream in the clean water on top of the flood .
     [java] 
     [java] We all tipped our paper valuables into Chris 's waterproof bag and tramped in mud back to base .
     [java] 
     [java] Keneally himself , researching the book , trod this same hazardous path in 1987 , and one may suppose that much of what Darcy describes , Keneally saw , that much of what Darcy feels , Keneally experienced .
     [java] 
     [java] She trod carefully in the house , trying to keep out of her mother 's way .
     [java] 
     [java] How could she possibly know that he was wading in blood from a self-inflicted wound ?
     [java] 
     [java] Within minutes , five or six men had taken off their shoes , rolled up their trousers and were wading in the icy water .
     [java] 
     [java] Mum and Dad had an ice too , and we all went for a little walk in the sunshine .
     [java] 
     [java] There were a few cows in the field and they were wandering in the direction of the sniper 's position .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I do n't share with him but he 's always wandering in my room looking to muck around .
     [java] 
     [java] We have been climbing in Wales , abseiling in many places , canoeing in the peak district , caving in Wales , pioneering in a local field , frostbite camping , night hiking and bare back stunt riding .
     [java] 
     [java] You should previously have been in charge of a small cruiser for at least two weeks ( perhaps on a two week flotilla ) , and you should be confident reefing your mainsail or paddling your rubber dinghy in strong winds .
     [java] 
     [java] Father Luke pedalled backwards in the direction of Whitechapel 's parish church and fell over the barrow .
     [java] 
     [java] He seemed to be talking to himself , and as he drew level he glanced suddenly in her direction .
     [java] 
     [java] He glanced briefly in the mirror again .
     [java] 
     [java] One look in those mesmerising night-dark eyes was enough to make her doubt that .
     [java] 
     [java] I sat holding the mug , looking in the direction from which I had walked .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , one day , when I was dressing it , I looked in the mirror and could see a small protrusion out of the lump .
     [java] 
     [java] A peek in the waste containers at the end of the lunch break is a good indicator of what should n't appear on the menu in future .
     [java] 
     [java] I caught myself taking a quick peek in the mirror behind the bar to see if my tie was straight .
     [java] 
     [java] Peek in the drawer again .
     [java] 
     [java] When I peep in the mirror , I see him squint across at her .
     [java] 
     [java] They 've peeped in tunnels they will not enter
     [java] 
     [java] The elderly Chas Varley was peering in some confusion at an arc of screens which pulsed with read-outs and rippling waveforms .
     [java] 
     [java] The kettle switched itself off , and she peered in a cupboard for a rarely used teatray .
     [java] 
     [java] Knots of Weimar citizens stood on street corners staring in curiosity .
     [java] 
     [java] Ruth stared in disbelief .
     [java] 
     [java] You 'll be able to borrow it from the office downstairs and view it in the library .
     [java] 
     [java] Gentle began to follow , but the fall had left him aching in every joint , and he knew the chase was lost before he 'd hobbled three yards .
     [java] 
     [java] She ached in every muscle from the constant strain of trying to keep her balance on the heaving deck .
     [java] 
     [java] The driver of the Transit was not badly hurt in the accident .
     [java] 
     [java] A TODDLER died and three other children were badly hurt in a house blaze .
     [java] 
     [java] THE families of two boys seriously hurt in a road accident are keeping a hospital bedside vigil .
     [java] 
     [java] Pins and needles tingled in her fingers and toes , creeping along her limbs until she felt as if she were disconnected from the world .
     [java] 
     [java] Can I feel tension in either of my legs ?
     [java] 
     [java] Could he feel the vibration in her shoulders from her heart , hammering like a piston behind her breastbone ?
     [java] 
     [java] They heard a car in the driveway , then the sound of footsteps rasping on brick paving , and the hum of a second car .
     [java] 
     [java] Of this , comparatively little was from Walter Machin himself , and some of these Greg had already seen in the Sunday paper articles .
     [java] 
     [java] If he held his hand over a flowering plant , he could sense in himself the healing properties of that flower .
     [java] 
     [java] In Britain their cause has been championed by Glynn Christian -- writer , broadcaster , TV gourmet and great-great-great-great grandson of Fletcher Christian who led the famous mutiny in 1798 .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The King of Heaven wishes to have no fellowship with lost and pagan so-called Kings ; for the eternal King reigns in Heaven , the lost pagan laments in Hell '' .

     [java] If he chose to , he could become quite authoritarian in his manner and cutting in his remarks but then , every Adviser needs some weapons in his armoury to survive !
     [java] 
     [java] The Town Council was then , as now , very strict in the matter of public morality .
     [java] 
     [java] Inheriting his mother 's religious principles , he was strict in his observances .
     [java] 
     [java] The Masai are pretty tolerant in these matters in my experience .
     [java] 
     [java] Chunks of chicken are flavoured with herbs and spices , then wrapped in a light pancake and coated in crunchy golden breadcrumbs .
     [java] 
     [java] Expansion in output was fuelled by growing external demand and generally expansive domestic economic policies .
     [java] 
     [java] Deep-sea fishing had entirely disappeared , but there was some expansion in the inshore sector , much of it in fishing for prawns .
     [java] 
     [java] It recommended a massive expansion in higher education ( from 216,000 places in 1962-3 to 390,000 in 1972-3 and 560,000 by 1980 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] Men were piling his furniture on to a cart in the street .
     [java] 
     [java] After he 'd been coaxed out of the cart in the yard , three serving women had carried him into the house .
     [java] 
     [java] The headmistress looked at the envelope in her hand with interested disappointment .
     [java] 
     [java] That night at the meeting , Karen had a big brown envelope in her bag .
     [java] 
     [java] She was economical in her conversation .
     [java] 
     [java] To be parsimonious in the use of parameters assists in the display of deviance ; in a prosecution it aids a portrayal of guilt , as an agency head explained :
     [java] 
     [java] The increase in secondary school enrolments in DET schools has far outstripped the rate of population increase .
     [java] 
     [java] Specifically relaxation produces a decrement in sympathetic nervous system activity and causes an increase in parasympathetic nervous system activity .
     [java] 
     [java] We have heard evidence that it was the rise in the price of rice , that you approved , which was the final straw .
     [java] 
     [java] The demand for cheap beef arose when North American beef soared in price , -- cattle ranching in South America is far less costly and a lucrative business deal for wealthy landowners .
     [java] 
     [java] With fifty deep-sea fishing boats and a growing trade in sea-coal , this small town on the cliffs grew steadily in prosperity .
     [java] 
     [java] Even as the mills were seen to decline in useful service , so too were the churches .
     [java] 
     [java] Punishment would consequently also dwindle in importance as the division of labour progresses , and punitive law be replaced by `` restitutive law '' which requires lawbreakers to make reparation to their victims rather than suffer retributive punishment .
     [java] 
     [java] Not only have tigers doubled in numbers , but other species and habitats have benefited .
     [java] 
     [java] They had their own ideas about who committed all the robberies in the area , and Oliver was unknown to them .
     [java] 
     [java] The unclaimed jewellery was part of the estimated 0m haul taken from the Knightsbridge Security deposit box robbery in 1987 .
     [java] 
     [java] They emanate from a time about 300,000 years after the Big Bang and show the first signs of fluctuations in the density of matter in space .
     [java] 
     [java] It is a method that can be tedious , confusing and not particularly reliable as readings can be made untrustworthy by fluctuations in general health .
     [java] 
     [java] First : why have there been such strong fluctuations in fertility in the last half-century , and are they likely to continue ?
     [java] 
     [java] Indeed , because of the fluctuation in oil prices under the effects of market forces , some staff redundancies have affected geologists and geophysicists , industrially and in government employment .
     [java] 
     [java] Over 7 years , the 22 sympatric species of Lauraceae showed great fluctuations in fruit production and this was apparently unconnected with weather or earlier reproductive behaviour .
     [java] 
     [java] The FT-SE 100 Index closed barely changed at 2679.2 , clobbered by a further leap in government borrowing and another stiff hike in the jobless figure .

     [java] The reception had told her the Scottish Football team were residents in the hotel which increased her hopes of picking up the odd tip in order to ease her way through University .
     [java] 
     [java] Local Legal Aid Secretaries are occasionally asked for information about the availability of legal aid in foreign countries for residents in Scotland .
     [java] 
     [java] To investigate the attitude of residents in a residential area of a city to a number of civic amenities , an agency decides to sample 200 adults from the area .

     [java] I will dwell in the frigid lands with my bride , and no man shall ever set eyes on us again ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] '' It 's unheard of for a religious Order to dwell in a tent or wagon .
     [java] 
     [java] In the 18th century Welsh and Irish painters and poets of note on their way to London stayed in the Port of Bristol .
     [java] 
     [java] We have been able to resume many former activities and look forward to going to France again , as we have done a number of times , and stay in a tiny village in the mountains of Provence .

     [java] IF YOU WANT to live in the dampest homes in England , rent a house or flat privately .

     [java] Pupils in schools designated for those with moderate learning difficulties have often met failure throughout their schooling .

     [java] I was frisked , my belt and Seiko taken from me , and , as an afterthought , kicked in the ribs .

     [java] Most tutors in EFL or ESOL are a product of that system .
     [java] 
     [java] In 1957 Andronikos was appointed a lecturer in classical archaeology at Thessaloniki University , and in 1961 promoted Professor ; he retired in 1983 .
     [java] 
     [java] The aim of this new scheme is to make selected awards to lecturers in Chemical Engineering or Polymer Chemistry who are engaged in research or teaching related to environmental issues .
     [java] 
     [java] JOHN SMITH , lecturer in the Law Department , warned Marian Jackson at the beginning of her second year that too much time spent with Dram Soc would prevent her from getting a first class degree .
     [java] 
     [java] An authority on the subject had tutored them in the accent used at that time .
     [java] 
     [java] '' The interpretive community formed around Rasta language and symbols , presided over and tutored in dread ethics by Marley and other outernational reggae artists , simply could not withstand these changes .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr. Duggan will still be tutoring in French from Kingsley Centre and one of his plans could be to set up a shop for Christian books , publications and cards in the Alton area .

     [java] 
     [java] A ceasefire had been agreed for the duration of the Supreme Soviet session , but reports emerged on Nov. 21 of a massacre in a refugee camp in the Tursunzadevsky region , near Dushanbe .
     [java] 
     [java] The disturbances began after squatters in the Koy-ye Tolab suburb attacked municipal officials who were checking construction permits .
     [java] 
     [java] Most dwellers in the temperate zones would agree , since centuries of conditioning by our surroundings have led us to see green as the fresh , life-giving backdrop to everything we perceive .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] There is a resigned look from Ann and Tony , but John and I ( the more English pair ? ) take ice axes and haul a small berg ashore , beating lumps off it for the tea .

     [java] 
     [java] Fran smiled , her face aching from the effort it cost to make the lie seem like the truth .

     [java] Now his left shoulder was aching from the lightning fast , iron-handed blow he had taken .

     [java] Although they were looking at the clump of bushes from a different angle now , she knew it was the same clump they had seen from the gate .
     [java] 
     [java] Black-and-white drawings could not convey even a remote impression of the emerald greenery of these wonderful hills nor the vast skyscapes and panoramic views seen from their summits .
     [java] 
     [java] We could n't see much from the window .

     [java] 
     [java]  During the late nineteen twenties and early thirties , the District was to pioneer rural areas schemes in Bedfordshire with Harold Shearman and in East Suffolk through William Whiteley .
     [java] 
     [java] The films were shot during the day .
     [java] 
     [java] The bone is also more extensively broken by the diurnal species during feeding , and it is less broken by owls .
     [java] 
     [java] Iran , in fact , was the Soviet Union 's largest trading partner in the Middle East during this period .
     [java] 
     [java] Consequently , during the last months of his life Edward conspired with Northumberland to exclude his half-sister from the throne and to elevate instead the duke 's Protestant daughter-in-law , Lady Jane Grey .

     [java] They chugged down river from the pier towards the entrance to the tunnel .
     [java] 
     [java] Armoured men with swords had clanked down the stairwells here ; now the steps were used by gunmen in grubby camouflage fatigues whose rifles lay propped against the walls of the round towers .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Too late , '' interrupted the skipper , clattering down wooden stairs which led from the deck .
     [java] 
     [java] Each passing minute brought one , two , or even more cabs and post chaises clattering down the street to great cheers and cries of `` In time !
     [java] 
     [java] With his unbuttoned shirt hanging outside his trousers , and his bare feet thrust into his shoes , he clattered out and down the stairs , his socks clutched ridiculously in his hand .
     [java] 
     [java] He clattered down the lane , and there was silence .
     [java] 
     [java] After Doug felt it was safe to leave them , and a neighbour had come in to help Mrs Fraser , they clumped down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] There was not a sound from Lily 's room until eleven when the bedroom door banged open and Lily pattered down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] If the lady of the house had swished down the stairs in a crinoline en route to her waiting carriage it would not have seemed out of place .
     [java] 
     [java] Since electrical pulses zinging down a wire are more regular and predictable than a steel cable moving inside a plastic cover , the result should be more precise control of engine revs and better fuel consumption .
     [java] 
     [java] Walk along the road until you come to Overton Hall Farm where you bear sharp right down bend in track .
     [java] 
     [java] We went carefully up the rickety stairs , wall bulges out here , and roof dips down there , torn matting and straying hooky rugs .
     [java] 
     [java] You dip down the drive from the Yoxford to Peasenhall road across an ornamental bridge and on towards this plain and golden Greek Revival house .
     [java] 
     [java] Despite their bare feet , our young guides strolled nonchalantly across these sections , apparently unconcerned that a single slip could send them plummeting down the mountainside .
     [java] 
     [java] We followed a narrow path that snaked precariously down the escarpment side .
     [java] 
     [java] She lived in the Palestinian camp at Rashidiyeh , a wretched four square miles of breeze-block huts and cabins relieved only by the occasional tree , a straggling plant hanging from a poorly made brick wall and an open sewer that snaked uneasily down the centre of the mud roads .
     [java] 
     [java] A small beard grew around the mouth and a pony tail weaved down his back .
     [java] 
     [java] In the event Mazzin was after the notebooks we 'd stuffed down the front of our pyjamas .
     [java] 
     [java] This is the queen who was greeted , on a visit to a Scottish university , by the sight of a student emptying down his throat , at top speed , the contents of a bottle of alcohol .
     [java] 
     [java] She ambled down roads and along paths that she knew well and she failed to record what she saw .
     [java] 
     [java] To guarantee integrity and fault tolerance , CA has ambled down the road to Tandem Computer Inc , and is currently in the labs developing a Unicenter version for Tandem 's Guardian , fault-tolerant operating system .
     [java] 
     [java] Peter backed down the hall and into the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] They all turned , just in time to see Sergeant bounding down the riverbank .
     [java] 
     [java] The manager , warmer than ever now , bustled down the aisle and made a short but moving speech about power-cuts and projectors , then asked us to bear with him .
     [java] 
     [java] Whitby is worth minor discomfort , however , and we quickly clambered down the 199 steps and strolled around the endlessly fascinating harbour and backstreets .
     [java] 
     [java] Endill hugged goodbye to the Bookman and climbed down the shelves , hoping no-one had spotted him .
     [java] 
     [java] Sandy McGlashan , the windlass man , climbed down the ladder and came to sit beside Cameron .
     [java] 
     [java] Do you have any idea how I 've felt , weekend after weekend , knowing you 're crawling down muddy holes or chucking yourself off cliffs ?
     [java] 
     [java] Inside her head , Gilly packed the brown suitcase and crept down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] Blair crept down to the bank whilst I rehearsed various reasons to explain why he had not caught the trout : lack of experience , bad casting technique .
     [java] 
     [java] Sara crept carefully down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] Watching from the window Muriel saw her swoop down the front steps , fling open the garden gate and dance across the road , past the Canoe Lake , and down the seafront in the direction of town .
     [java] 
     [java] A dash down the road , and happily on the first song of Monsterland 's set has gone a-begging .
     [java] 
     [java] At a speed that neither could match Louisa and Horrocks saw him hasten back down the lake .
     [java] 
     [java] Out of the window , as she hastened down the spiral staircase , Mildred saw the fires which were being lit in the ruins of the old castle where the celebrations were always held .
     [java] 
     [java] As a result , the Marines experienced no resistance as they jogged down the hurriedly lashed gangplanks , and spread out across the docks .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Come on , then , '' he said quietly , and began to jog down the bloody street .
     [java] 
     [java] Lennon shook Nathan off but the boy was already leaping down the stairs to where Zambia was writhing on the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] Blanche thanked the man for his help and he loped off down the corridor , jangling his keys .
     [java] 
     [java] He looked out of the window at the trucks lumbering through the mist , down the road towards Algeciras or heading east towards Malaga .
     [java] 
     [java] The truck smashed into the barrier , broke through it , lurched down an embankment .
     [java] 
     [java] She lurched down the hall and grabbed the receiver .
     [java] 
     [java] She marched down the passage towards the staircase .
     [java] 
     [java] An unspoken sympathy bound them in comfortable silence as they padded down the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] With the huge shaggy Kodiak bounding around me , I plodded down the path next morning in Mrs Knelle 's son 's wading boots .
     [java] 
     [java] Around half the region 's shoppers spend more than two hours a week plodding down the High Street in our search for bargains .
     [java] 
     [java] The boxer romped down the drive after me as I was leaving and the old man looked at him with undisguised admiration .
     [java] 
     [java] From time to time , a leaf would detach itself and sashay down to join its friends , slicing rideways , plunging headlong and then ripple-dissolving to the damp grass .
     [java] 
     [java] She scampered down the bank after the dog .
     [java] 
     [java] She scrambled down the tree as fast as she could .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he nudged Wa again , and sent him scurrying off down a nearby alley into the heart of the city .
     [java] 
     [java] The girl curtsied again before scuttling off down a nearby passage .
     [java] 
     [java] From there we had to shuffle down the underground to Davenports Magic Shop , where Paul had been lured in order to buy an ancient Chinese trick , hence the coolie gear .
     [java] 
     [java] Tossing back her head , she began to skip down the path towards him , swinging her bag , humming to herself .
     [java] 
     [java] Raskolnikov 's first thought on slinking down the lodging-house stairs is one of surprise at himself that he should be `` simultaneously '' in terror of his landlady and planning a murder .
     [java] 
     [java] Most of my friends collapsed thankfully on to their beds , but I slunk down the long flights of stone stairs and took up a position in the foyer where I could watch the front door .
     [java] 
     [java] He saw them before he heard them , three of them slithering down the steep slope to a phone box , miraculously intact , that stood near a riverside terrace that had escaped demolition .
     [java] 
     [java] She clung to the belief that Friend had sneaked down the wires through Karel 's network and one day he would come to rescue her .
     [java] 
     [java] Pousse-pousse ! '' yelled Chuck Sherman and sprang down the steps of the Continental Palace Hotel into the Rue Catinat with his arm raised in the manner of a French colon .
     [java] 
     [java] As soon as he turned the corner , I grabbed the wallet and sprinted down the alley .
     [java] 
     [java] Stella kept them waiting a long time , and when she did appear she sprinted off down the street ahead of them .
     [java] 
     [java] She staggered down the gangway , shell-shocked , and walked home feeling as if she was floating on air but as Saturday approached the nervousness began .
     [java] 
     [java] I was shaking so much that I had to lift the kettle with two hands when I staggered down the yard .
     [java] 
     [java] He threw down the knife , turned off the gas ring and stamped down the hall .
     [java] 
     [java] We stomped down the stone steps to collect our sacks and made for the Upper Tier of the crag .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he was gone and she watched him striding away down the street .
     [java] 
     [java] He strode briskly down the blue-carpeted corridor , the apartment keys already in his hand .
     [java] 
     [java] Pylons strode down from it , past a settlement and a water-tower on the plain due south of me and lost themselves in the haze to the west .
     [java] 
     [java] He walked away , thrusting the swing door out of his way and striding off down the corridor towards his office .
     [java] 
     [java] Strolling quietly together down the gravel paths of the old-fashioned Elizabethan knot garden , which was her mother 's pride and joy , Laura found the evening taking on a completely different complexion .
     [java] 
     [java] They strolled down to the Temple , in the evening sunshine .
     [java] 
     [java] But before she could continue , he was brushing past her roughtly , almost causing her to stagger and stumble back down the steps .
     [java] 
     [java] He fell forward , as a result of which there was a crowd surge and the people in front of him stumbled down the terraces .
     [java] 
     [java] Willie turned quickly and stumbled hurriedly down the path leaving Lucy to stare silently after him until he had disappeared into the cottage .
     [java] 
     [java] The clan held back politely as he swaggered down after the others into the sheltered hollow .
     [java] 
     [java] It 's possible that he tiptoed down the passage and came in by the main door .
     [java] 
     [java] It disturbed him to think of her father perhaps waking to hear him tiptoe down the passage like a shifty thief afraid of discovery .
     [java] 
     [java] It was the left corridor I chose , and I tiptoed reluctantly down it , holding my breath , for fear of disturbing the dragon which lurked within .
     [java] 
     [java] He tiptoed swiftly down the stairs , keeping close to the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] Athelstan , using all his weight , pushed Sir John back and sent him tottering down the corridor .
     [java] 
     [java] The glacier beyond was dirty and torturous , but we trekked down it to reach a sandspill outfall .
     [java] 
     [java] On seeing the car , she rose immediately and came tripping down the drive to unlock the tall iron gates .
     [java] 
     [java] So I trooped down there and muscled us in on the Bazooka Joe gig .
     [java] 
     [java] Frank saw me watching the sway of her buttocks as we trooped down a corridor .
     [java] 
     [java] Bodie was waiting for her as she trotted down the steps from the Centre , bag slung over one shoulder , slim body dressed in a bright blouse and pleated skirt .
     [java] 
     [java] There was not a soul in sight as Theda began resolutely to trudge down the street , looking for a lane that might lead her off the main road , which , being only of packed dirt , was already a hasty-pudding of mud which churned under her mercifully booted feet .
     [java] 
     [java] Here the load of a river is mainly mud and sand which is almost all that remains of the larger stones and boulders which have bounced and trundled many kilometres down river .
     [java] 
     [java] Straggling , catching up with one another , keeping more or less together , they had wandered over half a mile down the fields , always following the course of the brook .
     [java] 
     [java] Keith automatically began to turn the corner but when he saw I was carrying on to the bottom he stopped and wandered down after me .
     [java] 
     [java] All I could see , that I now remember , was this fellow in blue overalls wandering down the street outside , drinking a can of Coca Cola .
     [java] 
     [java] The adventurous can also canoe down the Amazon , trek through the Patagonian uplands , explore volcano craters , or sail round Cape Horn in a square rigger .
     [java] 
     [java] For Courtney this was a return to Africa , for he had been a big-game hunter and had once canoed down the Nile from Lake Victoria .
     [java] 
     [java] It was only necessary for him to cycle three hundred yards down the canal towpath to get home , but three times to Yanto 's knowledge he had ridden his bike into the canal .
     [java] 
     [java] Stan Weatherall and `` Darkie '' A. Harrison paddled their two-man canoe from Salen down the broad , rocky loch Sunart into the open sea on a clear day in February 1941 .
     [java] 
     [java] As we paddled on down this part of the river I became aware of a huge commotion behind me .
     [java] 
     [java] The postman was pedalling back towards them down the road .
     [java] 
     [java] During a summer romance together , the couple spent time at Oxford punting down the river , taking drives in the country and visiting local pubs .
     [java] 
     [java] They used to used to go up this , as you say it was part of the erm holiday , used to go up this mountain , driven up this mountain then they 'd toboggan down .
     [java] 
     [java] `` What the hell have you been up to ? '' she demanded , glancing down the road as if she expected Herbie Connors to appear on his bike .
     [java] 
     [java] He glanced down the codings listed on the last of the semi-opaque sheets and imprinted his authorisation .
     [java] 
     [java] She waited quietly , and then looked down the road .
     [java] 
     [java] He rose and went to the window , looking down the slope .
     [java] 
     [java] He explains how he felt a tingling sensation down his left-hand side but did not immediately call for help .
     [java] 
     [java] The other three turned and bolted off down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] As their men humped coarse sacks down this narrow lane , the gritty sugar inside would wear through the hessian and rub raw against their shoulders .
     [java] 
     [java] The route is mainly over the Coniston Fells giving a high rocky ridge walk , with a final descent down Little Langdale -- another quiet valley which still retains much of its old world character .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Goreng had been befriended by the French lady down the hill , who was an amateur painter ; so I was no longer required continually .
     [java] 
     [java] I heard Jean-Claude thud down the stairs and greet the man at the door .
     [java] 
     [java] The journey down the Grand Canal was a magical one for Meredith , in her warm glow of contentment .
     [java] 
     [java] Nutty practised the crawl in her bath and the water dripped down the light cord in the dining-room below and collected in the glass bowl-shaped shade .
     [java] 
     [java] Even from where Beth stood , she could see the blood trickling down Cissie 's arm .
     [java] 
     [java] This time the tears trickled down Katherine 's cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] As I looked up , I saw that water was beginning to slop in and trickle down the wall .
     [java] 
     [java] Both men were soaking as Lawton make his report , the drops trickling down their wet suits .
     [java] 
     [java] The captain 's gaze was fixed unblinkingly on the depth gauge , watching its hypnotic fall , great beads of perspiration trickling down his forehead .
     [java] 
     [java] The rain dribbled down Millet 's socks .
     [java] 
     [java] The basic solution is first to restrict the flow of water percolating down into the aquifers by planting trees , preferably native species , on the higher ground .
     [java] 
     [java] `` The biggest spanking you 've ever had , '' she answered promptly , coming down to earth ; and they proceeded down a steep zigzag path to the shore .
     [java] 
     [java] After dinner in the hotel restaurant David enjoyed sidling down the road .
     [java] 
     [java] We had to climb what seemed a never-ending staircase to a high platform where we took our seats in a punt at the top of a slide having water rushing down it .
     [java] 
     [java] She turned her head away , scalding tears coursing down her cheeks and on to the pillow which had absorbed her earlier grief .
     [java] 
     [java] She was crying hard now , tears coursing down her face over the pale curve of her cheeks .
     [java] 
     [java] There was blood streaming down her white nightdress and also soaking the bedcovers .
     [java] 
     [java] Sunlight streamed down over tawny bracken and the plum-bloom of the heather .
     [java] 
     [java] He looked up at them , panic-stricken , water streaming down his face .
     [java] 
     [java] His car had plunged down a motorway verge and into a wooden fence .
     [java] 
     [java] She plunged instantly down the slippery incline .
     [java] 
     [java] The thrust from the four giant engines pushed him back in his seat and the jumbo rolled down the runway , gathering speed by the second .
     [java] 
     [java] The white blanket rolled down the hillside and lapped over the roofs of the dwelling and outbuildings of the little farm .
     [java] 
     [java] This can be steep , making progress forward difficult -- you have to hold one wheel and push hard on the other just to stop yourself from rolling down it .
     [java] 
     [java] This prediction was borne out , though the tears that were shed rolled down the cheeks of Labour loyalists -- or better Labour chauvinists -- as well .
     [java] 
     [java] A trickle of sweat rolled down the side of Tom 's face .
     [java] 
     [java] Eight miles later , when they were coasting down a long hill , the engine spluttered .
     [java] 
     [java] He also threatened to drag him down the street handcuffed to the bumper of his car .
     [java] 
     [java] `` They 've shoved a bloody fish-hook down him ! '' exclaimed one of the men .
     [java] 
     [java] You always had to spit it out and shove it down the back of some chair .
     [java] 
     [java] He sank back into his chair as Pyke and I walked away from the table , and tossed the whisky down his throat .
     [java] 
     [java] The hound , which was shining with phosphorus , chased Sir Charles down the Yew Alley .
     [java] 
     [java] The mad boy screams as he chases the male nurses down the damp corridors .
     [java] 
     [java] As Dolly followed Boz down the stairs from the bedroom , she said , `` Seb met Constable Aplin in Burford and brought him back here with the doctor last night .
     [java] 
     [java] `` So it will confuse the trackers mightily -- especially since I think they picked us up at the Luxembourg border crossing , then followed us in our Mercedes down the autobahn . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Folk will pursue you down the street crying , `` You forgot your Biro . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I shadowed her down the tapering passage , all its planes carpet-covered , like four floors .
     [java] 
     [java] Kindly , he dried her face on a tea-towel , helped her on with her coat and shepherded her down the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] Finally she turned and disappeared down a short flight of stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 've got something to show you , '' he said , and disappeared back down the passage .
     [java] 
     [java] Noreen reached the front door just as his rainbow-coloured van was disappearing down the drive .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Well , the mouse jumped straight into his mouth and disappeared down his throat ! '' explained the woman .
     [java] 
     [java] Without waiting for an answer he disappeared down the ladder .
     [java] 
     [java] They disappeared down one of the side streets .
     [java] 
     [java] It was Friday morning , cold and clear after the night rain , and Annie brought Rachel down the stairs and settled her in the pram which was kept in the passageway beside the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] He splashed some down the front of my tunic and was gone .
     [java] 
     [java] One member of this party almost vanished down a hidden disused mineshaft on the walkout , thankfully managing to stop himself in time from going the distance !

     [java] If this is printed directly on a page printer at the same resolution the results seem reasonable but attempt to reproduce the image by photocopying or traditional printing and the lack of quality is all too apparent .

     [java] For what is displayed can be checked by others , and , if possible , reproduced by them .

     [java] Similarly , right hemisphere patients were inferior at reproducing by touch alone the angle at which two movable rods were set relative to each other ( De Renzi , Faglioni and Scotti 1971 ) .

     [java] A bee-hive , when it swarms , appears to reproduce by broad-fronted budding , like a wolf pack .

     [java] A gendarme ran in white-faced and clutched Fouchard by the arm , shouting , `` The ghost , Monsieur l `` Inspecteur . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` Funny joke , '' said Garvey , clutching his angel by the shirt .
     [java] 
     [java] Fand set her spear against the wall and knelt by Ruth , reaching out to touch her hand .
     [java] 
     [java] He stood by one of the huge wooden spoked wheels of the hay wagon and looked around .
     [java] 
     [java] Finally teachers ' guides are very frequently of a length and format and in a language which make them very , very difficult to comprehend by the average teacher .

     [java] `` Though we knew by the place where he had fallen that it must have been at the very summit just as the path runs down the cliff to Kinghorn Manor . ''

     [java] Making yourself aware of bias and adopting alternative usages should prevent the tacit presumption by your reader of the white male as a norm .
     [java] 
     [java] Graham , having understood the conversation by Sabrina 's gesticulation towards the padlock , shoved the youth roughly in the back towards the door .

     [java] Its functions are not always fully understood by academics and funding bodies .

     [java] Unless their discovery by their own employers might cause the Firm real problems ''
     [java] 
     [java] She found Adam by the bar , munching on a sausage roll , his plate piled high with tempting savouries .
     [java] 
     [java] You might recognize her by her kind and open face , a simplicity which you could easily overlook .
     [java] 
     [java] They recognized it by his ring .
     [java] 
     [java] Evidently they recognized the entrance by its surrounding landmarks , not by any stimulus from the entrance itself .
     [java] 
     [java] An essential ingredient of this is the ability to categorise each patient by disease type or treatment group .
     [java] 
     [java] The Hearsay-II system used segments categorized by manner of articulation features only , avoiding the more difficult task of specifying place of articulation .
     [java] 
     [java] These apartments situated right on the water have been awarded the highest possible classification by the English Tourist Board 2-5 Keys and Highly Commended .
     [java] 
     [java] Recall , we shall classify algorithms by their forms of input .
     [java] 
     [java] She termed people fair or dark , and there was scarcely one of the valley 's many-hued inhabitants whom she did not classify by colour .
     [java] 
     [java] And when morbidity statistics are available , they are not ordinarily classified by the demographic factors of present interest .
     [java] 
     [java] `` All part of the service '' was a phrase open to generous interpretation by early travel agents .
     [java]

     [java] There was a trace of rebellious contempt at the threat of authority .
     [java] 
     [java] Yes , you could mock at the idea , but that was n't enough to rid yourself of its insidious appeal , politely , persistently tugging at your soul .
     [java]

     [java] 
     [java] One of the passengers , an American , stood up and shouted at her .
     [java] 
     [java] One of them was shouting at the men behind the counter now ; a stream of threats and curses in Kuo Yu -- Mandarin -- while the two behind him looked about them threateningly .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I knew they had gone wrong and shouted at them to stop , '' said Nicholson on welcoming back his winner .
     [java] 
     [java] At last he rose and barked an order at one of the young men who placed the ladder lying on the ground against the scaffold , then gestured dramatically at Athelstan .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Control yourself , you silly witch , '' he barked at her .
     [java] 
     [java] She straightened up now and bawled across at him , `` You were a lad ; now you 're a young man .
     [java] 
     [java] By now the coroner should have been singing some lewd song at the top of his voice , bellowing abuse at the landlord , or urging Athelstan to come back to his house in Cheapside .
     [java] 
     [java] He bellowed at the Sikhs to retreat and as they stumbled back under a cross-fire from the other side of the hall , two of them fell dead and another mortally wounded .
     [java] 
     [java] They turned into an alleyway off Friday Street and Cranston began to bellow at passersby for the whereabouts of Parchmeiner 's shop .
     [java] 
     [java] He grew morose after that and growled at the customers , it seems -- so most took themselves to the next village for their ale .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I bleedin' owe you for that one , '' he growled at Joe .
     [java] 
     [java] He growled at the attendant , by now quite tipsy , and demanded another meal .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Who are you ? '' he growled at the stranger .
     [java] 
     [java] `` It 's two and a half guineas ! '' she hissed at Louise , who could tell that she was genuinely appalled .
     [java] 
     [java] The women were starting to wail , when he hissed at them to be quiet .
     [java] 
     [java] I could scream abuse at him all day long ; he would n't mind at all .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Kylie screams abuse at shop staff '' the banner headlines blared .
     [java] 
     [java] Sarah screamed at him : `` No , I bloody well wo n't , you gormless eejit !
     [java] 
     [java] `` Fucking bastard ! '' he shrieked at the wheelhouse as he dragged himself up the slimy wall , earrings gleaming .
     [java] 
     [java] He snarled the words at her .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Be quiet ! '' he snarled at her .
     [java] 
     [java] He was thundering at the hecklers .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm alone , '' he thundered at the television screen .
     [java] 
     [java] You know he yelled at Auntie Lou yesterday because he slipped on that mat in the hall ?
     [java]

     [java] She scarcely saw the streets of Swansea as the coach clattered along the cobbles , scattering a flurry of chickens that had been pecking at a fallen crust of bread .
     [java] 
     [java] She noticed that the horses drawing the `` olde '' cabs were not all that well cared for , and several clinked along with loose shoes .
     [java] 
     [java] I was n't sure it was a girl , at first , what with the shapeless and grimly robe she wore -- ankle-length , made of coarse brown cloth -- and the heavy oversized boots in which she was clumping along .
     [java] 
     [java] It pounded the soft earth and gurgled along the gutters to splash with relentless monotony into the tub outside the back door .

     [java] 
     [java] Dexter had been stationed in Brixton several years before and he inhaled the familiar atmosphere as he wound along Coldharbour Lane towards Peckham : the dilapidated shops selling second-hand furniture and televisions , the handsome couple posing against a car as though for a fashion magazine , the parked cars tumbling over the pavement .
     [java] 
     [java] We wound sedately along the narrow , grass-verged roads of `` The Oval '' council estate and glided through the town centre and five miles beyond , before reaching Ringinglow Road -- long , isolated and Roman straight -- and putting the car through its paces .
     [java] 
     [java] Cut into the sultry gold of his skin she saw a thin white line which zigzagged down from beside his eye , along his cheekbone , to his jaw .

     [java] Characteristic flight patterns include : quick dash along a hedgerow , up and over to pounce on prey ; fast low flight through wood or across open ground ; soaring , often in a circular glide with intermittent spasms of three or four wing-flaps ; also a gannet-like downward plummet with closed wings .
     [java] 
     [java] People were dashing along the roads in their night attire having just thrown on coats , my father went off first , next my mother and my Aunt Gertrude who lived with us .
     [java] 
     [java] Then we left , through the old city gates , skirting its wall as we hastened along alleyways and runnels down to the river quayside at East Watergate .
     [java] 
     [java] The surrounding countryside is quite lovely and you can take a pleasant amble along the river or a more challenging hike along the South Downs Way , which passes nearby .

     [java] 
     [java] Both Richard and Rob seem to be jogging along quite nicely .
     [java] 
     [java] Our fiacre jogged slowly along , slowed by the press of horse and motor traffic taking people back to their hotels for the evening .

     [java] 
     [java] A lone cat was padding almost invisibly along in the lee of a low wall .
     [java] 
     [java] Dinosaurs , too , walked on tip-toe ( i.e. they are known by paleontologists as being digitigrade ) whereas sprawlers pad along on their soles .
     [java] 
     [java] Tail wagging his thanks , he took the handle of the basket in his mouth and padded happily along beside Angela .
     [java] 
     [java] Of course the horse named Bess , which I was given had a mind of its own , since it would always be eating and when it was not it only plodded along .
     [java] 
     [java] I go to the gym in spite of myself , puffing and plodding along .
     [java] 
     [java] Tabitha pranced slowly along the hallway .
     [java] 
     [java] He almost pranced along the passage with his pet and I hoped fervently that I would not see them in there again .
     [java] 
     [java] One of them , Zowina , later remembered her fright when she encountered the strange red-haired man with the square forehead prowling along a dark passage at night .
     [java] 
     [java] And the ship , meanwhile , rushed relentlessly along its interrupted course to Vadinamia .
     [java] 
     [java] The idea burst into her mind , a sudden radiant solution , that she could rush along to the pet shop at lunchtime and apologize , ask him to forgive her and make everything all right .
     [java] 
     [java] At the state-run Peco garages , blue-jeaned secret policemen saunter along the lines of Dacias , checking who is playing truant from work .
     [java] 
     [java] Urquhart sauntered along thoughtfully for a moment , stopped and turned to face her .
     [java] 
     [java] I sauntered along to the control area , trying to be at ease .
     [java] 
     [java] Test conditions have included a scramble along Glencoe 's Aonach Eagach ridge and a two-day back pack in sweltering heat .
     [java] 
     [java] She scrambled along on leftover momentum , using her hands and knees more than her feet .
     [java] 
     [java] Leaves danced curlicues on the pavement as the wind ripped them from the plane trees and sent them scurrying along the ground .
     [java] 
     [java] Circles , straight lines and zig-zags can be chalked or painted on to a hard surface for children to walk , run , jump or skip along .
     [java] 
     [java] The two girls died when the car ploughed into them from behind as they skipped along a pavement .
     [java] 
     [java] She skipped along and into the wood at the end of the gardens .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Who is that young man ? '' she asked Peach , who was skipping along at her side .
     [java] 
     [java] Ruth smiled at her son who skipped along beside them , swinging on Connor 's hand , while Ruth pushed the new baby in her shiny new perambulator .
     [java] 
     [java] Skulk along the shore and feed off others '' carrion .
     [java] 
     [java] She slithered along the muddy ruts of the overgrown lane .
     [java] 
     [java] We trudge the shingle banks , or slip and slither our way along muddy sea walls , or negotiate sand dunes , or sea-watch for `` fly-bys '' from tall cliffs .
     [java] 
     [java] Ninety per cent of them just slog along with their heads down , following the established line and being intellectual conformists because it 's the easiest way to win peer approval .
     [java] 
     [java] I pulled up my coat collar and sprinted along the platform and into the shelter of the waiting room .
     [java] 
     [java] He sprinted along the bank and plunged into the freezing chest-deep water as the 15-month-old boy floated quickly away , face down .
     [java] 
     [java] She staggered along towards the aisle , stumbling over handbags and coats , the spectators rising and falling in a wave as she passed .
     [java] 
     [java] He stamped off along the tunnel .
     [java] 
     [java] This for them is just one step along the way .
     [java] 
     [java] Still very shaken , Steve Thomas retraces his steps along County Road in Swindon .
     [java] 
     [java] She stepped along quickly but quite gracefully .
     [java] 
     [java] As I strode along , glaring at the ground , hating everything , I thought : I 'm not dealing with this matter a moment too soon .
     [java] 
     [java] Towards Hammersmith was the river and its pubs , full of hollering middle-class voices ; and there were the secluded gardens which fringed the river along Lower Mall and the shaded stroll along the towpath to Barnes .
     [java] 
     [java] He took them for a stroll along the banks of the stream .
     [java] 
     [java] Alfred had inveigled Beatrice to take a stroll along the pier to gaze at the stars ; he was in exalted mood , and felt daring enough to ask her for her answer .
     [java] 
     [java] She did her best to make light of it , describing in detail the dinner they had eaten , and only hesitated a little when it came to the stroll along the promenade .
     [java] 
     [java] Today , no-one bats an eyelid as he takes a stroll along the ley-lines of Wiltshire .
     [java] 
     [java] SIDE BY SIDE : The lovers stroll along a country path , facing the future , just happy to be together
     [java] 
     [java] He turned and caught her looking at him as they strolled idly along by the whispering dark Mediterranean , and impulsively he stopped and pulled her into his arms for a quick hard hug .
     [java] 
     [java] Down the road , three guys strut along dressed in full Clockwise Orange gear -- white long johns , jock straps , black bowlers and canes .
     [java] 
     [java] As they strutted along to Marvin Gaye 's Motown smash hit I Heard it Through the Grapevine , these wrinkled little fellows captured the hearts of American youngsters .
     [java] 
     [java] The flimsy canvas-sided boat sank , leaving Graham Hayes to swim along the coast .
     [java] 
     [java] No doubt tonight , thought Lily , there will be tiptoeing along the corridors .
     [java] 
     [java] He flicked her a sideways glance , his mouth a thin line that sent fear tiptoeing along her spine .
     [java] 
     [java] Piper toddled along , holding the clown 's hand .
     [java] 
     [java] After my talk with Marcia I had tramped along the trails listening to imaginary advice from a weave of voices , the same ones I had silently and joyfully addressed at Machu Picchu .
     [java] 
     [java] More folk tramp along the sandy track with their paraphernalia .
     [java] 
     [java] They tramped along t o Ballechin among the ferns and sheltering oaks , smelling the cheesey smell of cows among the mist .
     [java] 
     [java] On Grafton Street in November We tripped lightly along the ledge
     [java] 
     [java] He trotted along the path to the footbridge , crossed it and raced out onto Water Meadow .
     [java] 
     [java] Outside it had turned dark and rather cold as Ranulf trotted along , following the curtain wall to the porter 's lodge near the gate .
     [java] 
     [java] All the while long lines of lorries trundled along the streets as if it was 1945 and the retreating Wehrmacht only a couple of miles away .
     [java] 
     [java] Chewing on her lower lip , she trundled after him along a flagged passageway and up an ornate wooden staircase .
     [java] 
     [java] In flew the ducks , crash-landing , splash ! -- up-ending , tail wagging , bill-dipping , wing-flapping , dabbling , diving , quacking , gobbling , waddling along the edge .
     [java] 
     [java] As I stood on the walkway , the water level reached above my knees , and I waded along beside the wall in the direction of the lower door and the river .
     [java] 
     [java] I even canoed and walked along the route taken by David Livingstone . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Even now , cycling idly along the lanes in the lee of the downs , it is possible to speculate about such things in a whimsical sort of way ; a rare tranquility which pervades everything brings about that state of mind .
     [java] 
     [java] As they cycled along side by side , Deirdre put a comradely hand on Jacob 's shoulder , as if to deny any accusation in her words .
     [java] 
     [java] It was warm and sunny , and for a brief time , as she cycled along to the nearest shops , she almost forgot what was to come that day .
     [java] 
     [java] A few moments before sundown I extricated Wavebreaker 's folding bicycle from the big locker on the boat 's after swim , forced the rusting hinges open , then pedalled along Midshipman Road to the glittering block of apartments where our esteemed boss lived .
     [java] 
     [java] '' I suppose we 'd better start having a look along the banks soon , although I must say I 'm in no particular hurry .
     [java] 
     [java] She looked along the river to where Wynne-Jones 's fire burned .
     [java] 
     [java] I peep along the corridor : no one again .
     [java] 
     [java] Felix spied along the length of his leg at the sock .
     [java] 
     [java] Culley 's teeth ached slightly along the line of the gum ; he imagined he could feel the air trickling through his lungs like snow-melt in a delta .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Should Jamie and I camp along to the pub and keep watch ?
     [java] 
     [java] An even bigger question mark hangs over the proposed Channel Tunnel railway between St Pancras station and the coast , given the enormous controversy the project has already raised among dwellers along the various routes proposed .
     [java] 
     [java] She lifted her hand to her immaculate hair , causing the many bracelets along her wasted arm to clank and clatter like old dustbin lids .

     [java] They steal a schooner and embark on a voyage through the Caribbean and along the Central American coast , terrified of retribution but indulging in the comfort of increasingly fantastic plans for a luxurious future .
     [java] 
     [java] After the wildflowers blossomed in March , they journeyed south along the lush Wallowa valley to gather wild roots like kouse and camas .
     [java] 
     [java] There was a car moving along the promenade towards them , on dipped headlights .
     [java] 
     [java] Jessie sidled along by the racks to the door leading to the passage and the stairs .
     [java] 
     [java] The little Cornish fishing village of Polperro is one of the many picturesque sights encountered on a trip along the southern coastline of the country .
     [java] 
     [java] For visitors interested in making the journey to Bauen by private transport the route could be combined with a trip from Brunnen along the Axenstrasse to Fluelen and Altdorf .
     [java] 
     [java] She gave a tiny strangled gasp and shuddered , feeling the waves of shock coursing along her veins .
     [java] 
     [java] Men crawled over the area like ants over an anthill , and several small handcarts rolled along here and there .
     [java] 
     [java] She rolled along the carpet , hampered by her long dressing-gown , and then arms like steel tentacles caught her again .
     [java] 
     [java] Now and then a door slammed , sending metallic echoes rolling along the corridors .
     [java] 
     [java] Soon we were off , heading northward , along the coastal road .
     [java] 
     [java] The rain came as I reached the drive of the hotel , set amongst trees , and I ventured along it in search of shelter .
     [java] 
     [java] The traffic was too heavy for her to go to the driver 's side and she stormed along the pavement to the offending car and opened the passenger door .
     [java] 
     [java] The Nawab was sprawled next to her on the pearlgrey upholstery , one lag laid over the other , his arm flung carelessly along the back .

     [java] 
     [java] Now Mrs Knelle drove away from the lake , along a narrow road between green hills where sheep grazed .
     [java]

     [java] He looked surprised at her request for a word in private , but readily agreed and led her across the hotel reception hall , out through a door at the rear of the building and into the garden .
     [java] 
     [java] Remember your bible , when Moses led his tribes across the Red Sea .
     [java] 
     [java] But there 's an Italian officer called di Marco who led expeditions across the Sahara before the war- ''
     [java] 
     [java] He built roads , civilized the people and departed across the sea on a magic `` raft of serpents '' .
     [java] 
     [java] But Pippin escaped , returned to Aquitaine , and forced Louis to withdraw across the Loire '' in less dignified fashion than was suitable '' , taking Charles with him .
     [java] 
     [java] Chugging across the dark river with these two fellers in the outboard , I relax with them .
     [java] 
     [java] He caught her towards him and kissed her until she was breathless , and even in her daze she heard Candace 's high heels clicking angrily across the back of the hall .
     [java] 
     [java] Gaggia machines burbled on marble bars , new secretaries clicked across polished floors , uniformed valets twirled glass doors .
     [java] 
     [java] I did n't see the great walled city of Chanchen , only the mist and rain , the blur of the headlights and the windscreen wipers clicking endlessly across my vision .
     [java] 
     [java] The seas were hot , volcanoes spouted ash and lava , and electrical storms crackled across the skies .
     [java] 
     [java] The car ahead of them squealed to a halt , crashed backwards across the road into a stone wall , and came to an abrupt stop .
     [java] 
     [java] She heard her mother 's slippers crunching across the sugar-strewn floor .
     [java] 
     [java] On one occasion a furious blizzard howled across a landscape illuminated by a sunset of bloodshot gold .
     [java] 
     [java] I squelched across tiny burns running in black channels of peat , and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roofs of Scaup Farm .
     [java] 
     [java] Torrential rain put a damper on the event , sending bedraggled guests squelching across lawns to seek shelter .
     [java] 
     [java] Sensations rushed in : the cries of the traders in the street below them mixed with the screams of the swallows that swished low across the roofs ; the dark aroma of the strong coffee mingled with the fresh smell of the bread .
     [java] 
     [java] When the beachmaster is angered by a serious challenge , he thunders across the sand , humping and heaving his huge body with surprising speed and taking no notice whatever of what lies in his way .
     [java] 
     [java] He said -- `` From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic , an iron curtain had descended across the continent of Europe '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Within 2.5km ( 1+ miles ) the road forks and the right-hand branch dips across a hollow towards Schwendi ; but continue forward , climbing on the left-hand ( main ) road which ascends towards Goldiwil at a higher level with even more rewarding views .
     [java] 
     [java] Growing thirstier and hungrier and wearier and unhappier , as the blistering sun edged across the sky .
     [java] 
     [java] She stood still on the track , and , as she stared up at him , the shaft of moonlight slanting across her , her face betrayed surprise as she exclaimed , `` Silas -- you amaze me .
     [java] 
     [java] Shadows cast by the open door slanted across the strong lines of nose and jaw , softening the hard line of his mouth .
     [java] 
     [java] The light slanted across her skin in such a way the tiny blonde hairs showed like fair fluff .
     [java] 
     [java] He turned and made a few fast strokes in pursuit , and swam into a current of colder water that snaked across the bay and washed round him .
     [java] 
     [java] Hoses snaked across the floor from the freighters to the tanks , while cables stretched out from blocky generators like the arms of octopi .
     [java] 
     [java] It veered out of control , swerved across the road and crashed into a shop front .
     [java] 
     [java] In the paddleboat we start right and weave a stylish course across the left of the rapid , dodging the holes .
     [java] 
     [java] Herr Nordern wove unsteadily across the living-room into the bathroom and plunged his face into cold water .
     [java] 
     [java] They wove across the metallic dunes , submerging themselves like roots , surfacing again , twitching , throbbing sluggishly .
     [java] 
     [java] To produce the low scarps which wind across the Mercurian surface the radius of Mercury need only have decreased by a few tenths of a percent .
     [java] 
     [java] He backed across the room keeping pieces of furniture between himself and the three of us .
     [java] 
     [java] A flicker of movement to the left caught his eye and abruptly he was braking as a deer bounded across the narrow road .
     [java] 
     [java] As we clambered across the rubble towards him , our 12-year-old boy in 1976 knew that the nearest tank was only 300 yards away .
     [java] 
     [java] She came crawling across the pitch-black floor , the scuff of her knees completely muffled by the clatter of raindrops .
     [java] 
     [java] Dark heavy clouds were crawling across the sky , blotting out the stars .
     [java] 
     [java] Slipping off the bed she crept across her room , opening the door as silently as possible .
     [java] 
     [java] She crept softly across the room to the piano and touched the keys , although without applying any pressure .
     [java] 
     [java] She laughed out loud , almost danced across the paved floor of the courtyard .
     [java] 
     [java] He tried to knock some aside but they clung to his fingers and a spider danced across his knuckles and disappeared up his sleeve .
     [java] 
     [java] Stones danced across the road , bouncing like heavy rain .
     [java] 
     [java] Birds dart across the road , shoulders hunched into the sea wind .
     [java] 
     [java] He dashed across the garden and pounced upon the garden gate , pressing the latch with his big feet .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I know , '' he whispered , and a smile flitted across the devastatingly handsome cast of his face .
     [java] 
     [java] But it was one of the twins , in fluffy pyjamas , who flitted across the landing like a moth , eyes half-shut under the electric light .
     [java] 
     [java] They can be observed flitting across the pit as they attempt to swim , with the parent picking them up and spitting them back into the quivering mass .
     [java] 
     [java] What with the jug of Red Snappers that Fielding had prepared , I was feeling no pain when the first candidate came flouncing across the floor .
     [java] 
     [java] So the question of her taking a five-mile hike across what in parts was sometimes rough terrain would never have occurred .
     [java] 
     [java] She hopped across the lane and the ditch , and entered the woods .
     [java] 
     [java] She hurried across the bridge and down the path , then climbed the wooden steps up on to the terrace .
     [java] 
     [java] She vaulted over a boulder and started to jog across the plateau .
     [java] 
     [java] With a grunt of exasperation , Henry leapt across the room and into the yard , crossing the space between kitchen and dining room until he reached the stables .
     [java] 
     [java] Corbett thought it was mere drunken bravado when one of them lunged across the table and uproar ensued as food , cups and flagons of wine and ale were sent sprawling .
     [java] 
     [java] He lunged across the table ( so much for forced calmness ) , his hands reaching round the back of her neck to pull her towards him .
     [java] 
     [java] One night they almost snapped an axle when Jed 's eyes fell shut and the car left the highway and began to lurch across dry yellow grass .
     [java] 
     [java] He saluted again and marched across the yard to his car .
     [java] 
     [java] I watched Thursday mince across the hall to her desk .
     [java] 
     [java] Henry stood up and padded across the thick carpet to the window .
     [java] 
     [java] Neville rose from his seat and padded across the threadbare carpet to the whisky optic .
     [java] 
     [java] Masklin got up and padded across the metal floor to the door .
     [java] 
     [java] Then , before anyone could stop her , Doreen rushed across the kitchen to slap Lucy 's face and pound viciously at her head with closed fists .
     [java] 
     [java] Water rushed across the road to the Nile Hotel , carrying scorpions and reptiles into the drowning rooms .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Nice cows , '' he said , watching two stately ruminants sashay through the long grass across the river and sway lazily down to drink .
     [java] 
     [java] Pedestrians scampered blindly across the road to catch waiting buses , the cars jerked ahead a few yards every time the traffic lights turned to green .
     [java] 
     [java] Others had scrambled across the field , dodging shellbursts , and had taken off only to forget where they were supposed to be going .
     [java] 
     [java] Ahead of him , the tail-end stragglers of the daily rush hour traffic scurried across Westminster Bridge .
     [java] 
     [java] Quick kiss on the cheek for Lucy and Frieda , watch their skinny legs scuttle across the yard and in through the corrugated iron hut 's battered doors .
     [java] 
     [java] She shuffled across the kitchen to the sink .
     [java] 
     [java] Old men shuffle across the tiles to be greeted with `` Good afternoon , milord '' , by tailcoated attendants .
     [java] 
     [java] Maura 's eyes lit up and she skipped across the road to meet him .
     [java] 
     [java] Glancing up the American boy saw a peasant pole-carrier , who had skipped across the road close in front of the Citron , grinning triumphantly from a roadside ditch .
     [java] 
     [java] Still , there was safety in numbers , even sparse ones , so she skipped smartly across the street , shortening her stride to keep pace with the woman 's slower one .
     [java] 
     [java] As he slithers across the mud I gain on him .
     [java] 
     [java] Hundreds of them suddenly erupt from a tiny hole in the sand and start sprinting across the dune looking for the bodies of insects that may have collapsed from heat stress .
     [java] 
     [java] `` This is difficult , very difficult , '' said one Bosnian soldier as he crouched in a trench about to sprint across open ground under the sights of Serb gunners .
     [java] 
     [java] Sprinting across it , he reached a particularly thick-trunked tree at the farther edge .
     [java] 
     [java] He got up and stole across the grass .
     [java] 
     [java] Long steps across the width of the pool invite a grinning entrance into the waters .
     [java] 
     [java] This transition can be accomplished in 29 branchings , which we may naively think of as a stately walk of 29 steps across genetic space .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Where 's your car ? '' she asked in sudden alarm , as he lurched to his feet and took a couple of unsteady steps across the kitchen .
     [java] 
     [java] We go outside , stepping across the driveway to the garage .
     [java] 
     [java] You can step across the fording on the rocks . ''
     [java] 
     [java] I was feeling pretty angry with her as I stomped across that big field , but when I reached her my heart just melted .
     [java] 
     [java] Guido dropped her cases and strode across the tiled floor .
     [java] 
     [java] And westerners , though many enjoy east Berlin 's theatres and museums , seldom feel inclined to take a stroll across the concrete acres of Alexanderplatz .
     [java] 
     [java] It would be pleasant on this cold sharp morning to stroll across the fields and listen to the bells .
     [java] 
     [java] Perhaps after a cold swim across the channel , as your own personal adventure begins to unfold , you too will begin to understand .
     [java] 
     [java] I slipped off my heels and tiptoed across the room .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Not very gallant , '' Lefevre pointed out , `` to make her traipse across the road in this weather .
     [java] 
     [java] They go round and round , and begin to vibrate frighteningly , so that the whole washing-machine starts to tramp across the kitchen floor , in a growing flood of hot soapy water
     [java] 
     [java] NORWEGIAN explorer Erling Kagge , 29 , aiming to become the first person to walk alone to the South Pole , left Oslo yesterday after piling on 18lbs of fat with huge meals to give him energy resources for his two months on the ice trekking 814 miles across the Antarctica .
     [java] 
     [java] I heard her trip across the floor and the door closed behind her .
     [java] 
     [java] A freezing weekend in Devon was spent trudging across frost-flecked moors .
     [java] 
     [java] He leapt up from his bench and waddled across the foredeck like an enormous goose .
     [java] 
     [java] A walk across the moor to the north from this point soon arrives at an area of limestone pierced by the many shafts of Tailbrigg Pots .
     [java] 
     [java] Even a twenty minute walk across the park , and a sandwich in the fresh air , is an effective way of using time productively .
     [java] 
     [java] Twice in Morocco he was arrested and interrogated as a spy by the French Foreign Legion who refused to believe that anyone would spend their holidays cycling across the desert in temperatures of 48 '' C.
     [java]

     [java] He flicked a glance across his shoulder .
     [java] 
     [java] A look across the Irish Sea finds Stephen Dedalus defining a particular sort of foreignness in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man when he meets an English priest and reflects that :
     [java] 
     [java] The man picked up a small portmanteau that had been hidden in shadow by the rail , and with one last sweeping look across the quay , climbed on to the gangplank .
     [java] 
     [java] We stood staring across the icy water at the mist-shrouded island .
     [java] 
     [java] He knelt beside her and she saw concern flash across his features .
     [java] 
     [java] The church was founded to guard the Romanesque bridge across the Vltava , chains being placed across the route .
     [java] 
     [java] Jewel-bright windows , veiled in lead , gaze on slender arched bridges across the Cam .
     [java] 
     [java] Trafalgar House plc is constructing a bridge across the River Thames above the Dartford Tunnels , which it runs , using the tolls to pay for the bridge .
     [java] 
     [java] It was a farm track , little more than a rough pathway across the fields .
     [java] 
     [java] We described stratification earlier as a stable structure of inequality between groups which persist across generations .
     [java] 
     [java] He scattered the letters across his desk .

     [java] 
     [java] When he travelled across America it was not so much the places as the travelling which found its way into his pictures .
     [java] 
     [java] By 1907 , she was the madam of the most luxurious of the Dublin brothels , and she had travelled extensively across Europe .
     [java] 
     [java] Once there they would journey across Belgium and drive `` sedately '' on far into Germany where they would rest overnight .
     [java] 
     [java] These provisions were not barter for friendly natives but food for her mammoth journey across Europe , Russia , Siberia and Manchuria .
     [java] 
     [java] She 'd hated the submarine journey across the North Sea , especially as she was a bit claustrophobic , but stepping over the side into that ridiculous little rubber boat was terrifying .
     [java] 
     [java] The drizzle fell steadily , dribbling across the pock-marked tarmac , forcing forlorn figures at bus-stops to huddle together even closer under the shelters .
     [java] 
     [java] I remember one day she slapped me across the jaw .
     [java] 
     [java] Elsie had wept for kind Mrs Doran and for her husband , that strange , silent , sympathetic man , lifting his feet cautiously as he sidled across the polished floor .
     [java] 
     [java] A Radioactive cloud that drifted across Britain after a fire at the Windscale nuclear factory in Cumbria in 1957 may have killed hundreds of people .
     [java] 
     [java] The rain was still drifting across the distant mountain range when they left the hotel , blurring their outlines , obscuring the lough .
     [java] 
     [java] Laughter drifted across the water as the long , high-sided boat made its way out across the lake , the lanterns swinging gently on either side .
     [java] 
     [java] Withel stormed across the floor , his face a mask of rage .
     [java] 
     [java] His distinguishing marks were a duelling scar across his hand , and also a deformed thumb that had been broken and badly reset ; it gave the impression of a parrot 's bill .
     [java] 
     [java] He had surprisingly fine hands , long , slender and strong , but there were tell-tale scars across the knuckles , pale against the tanned skin .
     [java] 
     [java] A local man offers to ferry me across the fjord and I am soon on the way to Holt .
     [java] 
     [java] Billy could easily have ferried her across the river in his boat , as he had done many times before .
     [java] 
     [java] Jetting across the Atlantic , after two years in America , she had looked forward to seeing her home town from the air , to retracing toy-sized , familiar landmarks , to marvelling at new unfamiliar ones .
     [java] 
     [java] An hour later , taxiing across the glimmering surface of the lake , the floatplane approached the jetty .
     [java] 
     [java] Her torch flickered across the wall and she switched it off , holding her breath in case someone had noticed the distant gleam of light .
     [java] 
     [java] Lie across the bench with the dumb-bell overhead and the elbows slightly bent .
     [java] 
     [java] She leaned across the desk .
     [java] 
     [java] The door shot open , knocking Bill from his feet and sending him sprawling across the sidewalk .

     [java] It , too , was nearly dead , but he was persuaded to release it in a bay long enough for it to be filmed with an underwater camera as it swam slowly above the bottom .

     [java] Halfway up the street she paused to look above the church to the hill beyond .
     [java] 
     [java] Look above the shop fronts to the upper floors above nos. 33-45 St. Giles Street .

     [java] By themselves the facts are neutral but in so far as moral views about the proper role of the media are based upon presumptions about facts , our empirical findings are bound to have moral implications .

     [java] In this way , it is believed , linguists will be able to make discoveries about the language itself , and its system of rules which exists quite independently of particular circumstances .
     [java] 
     [java] The mind of the human observer is endowed with creative imagination ; this allows the scientist not only to make discoveries about the laws of nature but to tamper with them and exploit them to his own advantage .
     [java] 
     [java] This programme capitalises on recent discoveries about the nature of urban change .
     [java] 
     [java] I keep brooding about this morning 's telephone call to my agent .
     [java] 
     [java] One would construct alternative scenarios , and brood about them .
     [java] 
     [java] Clark not only dissents but is hopeful enough to scorn utilitarian considerations about humane husbandry and so forth :
     [java] 
     [java] Kripke 's interpretation of the private language argument holds that a negative answer to the last question is a consequence of more general considerations about rules and objectivity .
     [java] 
     [java] As so often happened , she deliberated too long about the introduction of her own affairs , and when she finally found the courage to speak , she chose a bad moment .
     [java] 
     [java] The only change in the intervening period had been that the government had prepared for the threatened dispute while the Samuel Commission deliberated about the way in which to make the industry more efficient and profitable .
     [java] 
     [java] Clearly this is useful for tasks which involve extensive scanning of information sources and deliberations about what action to take .
     [java] 
     [java] Balbinder , who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future , had not seen his new school yet .
     [java] 
     [java] He lifted another log onto the fire as we mused about climbing possibilities , and poured another round of rather large drinks .
     [java] 
     [java] Perhaps indeed it did , as one thing among others , possibly the most extreme , stir up dramatic reflections about a God which is no god but a significant emptiness full of pain , and so on .
     [java] 
     [java] Even if the brain were designed so that components could be easily removed , there is the issue of what we can conclude about the functions of its components from knowing the effects of removing one of them .
     [java] 
     [java] What are we to conclude about the implications for his later personality of the way in which a child is treated during his early years ?
     [java] 
     [java] By itself an experiment allows us to draw conclusions about the particular conditions in that experiment , and nothing else .
     [java] 
     [java] This conclusion about the selective nature of close confiding is supported by evidence from a variety of sources .
     [java] 
     [java] Working from this hypothesis , it is possible to make one further deduction about the date of the original code .
     [java] 
     [java] He must draw deductions about what he thinks took place from the evidence that is presented to him .
     [java] 
     [java] The law requires the chief of police to make educated guesses about the likelihood that disorder , damage or disruption will occur .
     [java] 
     [java] NOT FOR the first time , Pakistan 's selectors kept onlookers guessing about the make-up of their team .
     [java] 
     [java] Aggregate data do not , of course , allow us to draw any inferences about the behaviour of individual authorities which give rise to these findings , particularly where so few cases are often involved .
     [java] 
     [java] We must make inferences about the health status of the survivors from these data .
     [java] 
     [java] Similarly we can only make inferences about the nature of learning from observing these changes .
     [java] 
     [java] Additionally , human readers are able to make a multitude of inferences about the sentences within a discourse .
     [java] 
     [java] Journalistic speculation and inference about official statements are not protected .
     [java] 
     [java] Anthropologists usually spend some years learning about the cultures of `` their '' people by living with them .
     [java] 
     [java] Many man-haters , in my experience , come fresh from a traumatic relationship with a man , or a recent realization about men .
     [java] 
     [java] One thing I realised about my renewal of my faith is that I had nothing to do with it !
     [java] 
     [java] Prisoners were scornful about the sense of priorities this demonstrated , and about the supposed benefits .
     [java] 
     [java] In any case there is something absurd about the notion that language or words can be attacked independently of their users .
     [java] 
     [java] THERE is still something slightly absurd about the notion that 4,812,000 people cast their votes for Mr Dan Duffy .
     [java] 
     [java] If there was one thing not ugly and absurd about that marriage , it was a small but irreversible change in her own situation .
     [java] 
     [java] Our printing forefathers were notoriously careless about their pagination .
     [java] 
     [java] In this day and age people are rightly cynical about propositions concerning the power of ideas .
     [java] 
     [java] Life in Paradise Street had made her cynical about police work .
     [java] 
     [java] Be sensible about this so that everything will be organised and ready on time .
     [java] 
     [java] Market research has shown us that people are far more health conscious and far more sensible about what they drink .
     [java] 
     [java] He was candid about his missionary ancestry .
     [java] 
     [java] Modigliani did not gossip , he was too preoccupied and always discreet about his love affairs .
     [java] 
     [java] Valentin has been discreet about his upbringing .
     [java] 
     [java] Eddie would have to be pretty discreet about her relationship with Angy if she wanted to persuade Aunt Rosina to hand over that sketch as a keepsake .
     [java] 
     [java] Mangla is not explicit about the World Bank 's improved drug delivery system .
     [java] 
     [java] You would n't exactly describe Intel as forthcoming about the P5 at the Hot Chips Conference at Stanford University the week before last .
     [java] 
     [java] Woman are more likely to be frank about the primacy of personal relationships .
     [java] 
     [java] Edward , invited to give an account of himself and be frank about it , did so .
     [java] 
     [java] Let 's be honest about our failings .
     [java] 
     [java] The important thing is to be open about yourself -- both in terms of where you are oppressed and where you oppress others .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 've always been pretty open about my sexuality , '' she says .
     [java] 
     [java] But electoral success gave the Jacobites a greater visibility at the centre of politics , and perhaps encouraged fellow travellers in the localities to become more open about their political convictions .
     [java] 
     [java] The man himself , is quite outspoken about past and present , but mostly about the future .
     [java] 
     [java] He was equally outspoken about the servile wars in Sicily ( as we can deduce from Diodorus who follows him ) .
     [java] 
     [java] We will be less secretive about the workings of government .
     [java] 
     [java] To an amazing -- even an alarming -- extent , Karen Parsons was totally straightforward about what she wanted to do with her body and what she liked having done to it .
     [java] 
     [java] But it was because I needed other women , and I needed to be truthful about it .
     [java] 
     [java] Nearly half of the Bank 's borrower-governments break their promises about economic policy .
     [java] 
     [java] Bearing in mind that Labour Members have made many promises without costing them , will my hon. Friend tell us whether they have made promises about the environment in which they claim to be interested ?
     [java] 
     [java] He said Ms Armstrong 's promises about nursery provision were like `` whistling in the wind '' .
     [java] 
     [java] So presumably , other creatures are simply talking and communicating about the world according to their particular mind configurations .
     [java] 
     [java] I have already mentioned Anselm 's firm refusal to confer about the discipline of the English Church with the papal legate who brought his pallium .
     [java] 
     [java] On the other hand , there are those on both sides whom I would label `` meaning '' theists and `` meaning '' atheists , between whom a dialogue about God 's existence can take place .
     [java] 
     [java] If the manual achieves one thing , it will be to increase the dialogue about issues between staff , suppliers , guests and local authorities . ''
     [java] 
     [java] A Compact gives teachers the chance to involve employers in dialogue about the use and form of such records .
     [java] 
     [java] They have meetings about it !
     [java] 
     [java] That 's why I thought you 'd heard about me from Tansy .
     [java] 
     [java] We want to hear about the last visit you made to the hairdressers .
     [java] 
     [java] He has read a lot about AIDS medicine .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'd read about the Old Bailey and that sort of thing .
     [java] 
     [java] She read about it and saw it on television .
     [java] 
     [java] I read about you in the evening paper .
     [java] 
     [java] He started blustering about the general election and an end to the inflationary spiral .
     [java] 
     [java] We chattered about Ipswich and I found the business of Scawsby 's treatment of my mother still rankled in my heart .
     [java] 
     [java] My dearest love , I chatter about all sorts of odd news , when I really only want to tell you that my real self is in your keeping .
     [java] 
     [java] The girl shrugged and mumbled about him being too busy .
     [java] 
     [java] Although he was pleased that they had managed to set everything up on time , he continued to mutter about the remaining android being alive , threatening them from somewhere on the planet .
     [java] 
     [java] The housekeeper left the room , muttering about ingratitude .
     [java] 
     [java] `` When you started prattling about that man I sometimes saw here before I ever went up to Oxford , '' she said .
     [java] 
     [java] He raved about that delicacy each and every time we met .
     [java] 
     [java] The press here , like the list , are raving about Kelly .
     [java] 
     [java] Most of them were black ; now black and white girls were singing about their boyfriends .
     [java] 
     [java] He sang about his love of the sea .
     [java] 
     [java] Sometimes she saw nurses whispering about her and wanted to hide .
     [java] 
     [java] One of his body squires heard him whispering about it to his Gascon favourite . ''
     [java] 
     [java] And even if you score a triumph , avoid crowing about your success .
     [java] 
     [java] She invites me into the living room , pours me a coffee , sits down beside me , slips her shoes off and groans about the working day she has just been through .
     [java] 
     [java] After emerging from the sea for the fourth time he groaned about his physique .
     [java] 
     [java] Not a squeeze of anything `` progressive '' or `` experimental '' came from these pallid , vicious little council estate kids with hedgehog hair , howling about anarchy and hatred .
     [java] 
     [java] Drinkers also moaned about dirt and smells in pubs , bad toilets and `` down-at-heel '' gardens .
     [java] 
     [java] History was taught by a whiskery professor who thundered about the Origin and Destiny of Imperial Britain .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Oh , for heaven 's sake stop twittering about Fabio .
     [java] 
     [java] Revocation of all picnicking privileges , even though I whine about my health and name flowers in English until I 'm blue in the face .
     [java] 
     [java] Instead of whining about my memory I should be thanking my lucky stars I 'm alive at all . ''
     [java] 
     [java] My father grilled us about what we had been doing all week .
     [java] 
     [java] Over the first course I made the usual polite inquiries about Sally 's new job and asked her what she had been up to for the last half-dozen years or so .
     [java] 
     [java] If you have any queries about the help you may get , ask at the hospital .
     [java] 
     [java] If you have any queries about the enclosed information please do not hesitate to contact us .
     [java] 
     [java] While we are happy to answer any queries about our own products , we can not answer for the content of other publisher 's works .
     [java] 
     [java] `` No chance , '' she stated swiftly on a light laugh , and quickly dismissed the subject by turning to her host with a query about the wine that went so well with the meal .
     [java] 
     [java] But Harriet had returned to Meredith 's query about the cottages .
     [java] 
     [java] These three , also from South Ronaldsay , had been abused , and were undergoing extensive questioning about it .
     [java] 
     [java] The only exception was the questioning about which area should be avoided in reselling the goods .
     [java] 
     [java] He ca n't give me any straight answers about all this because he is only concerned with the state-run prison service .
     [java] 
     [java] Under cross-examination I added a few more details about my supposed activities .
     [java] 
     [java] It was only thanks to the scene made by Gilly that his admission about their visit to Puddephat's rooms had gone unnoticed.
     [java] 
     [java] Since leaving Berlin Blake had had one or two scares when various West Germans had been arrested for spying and made allegations about him .
     [java] 
     [java] Western allegations about Iran 's nuclear ambitions had been mounting .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Fernie , I gather you 've been making certain allegations about your neighbour , Mr Connon . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Four years ago Count Nikolai Tolstoy was successfully sued by Lord Aldington over allegations about the repatriation of Cossacks and Slavs after the Second World War .
     [java] 
     [java] The momentum of the Tyminski campaign faltered amid further allegations about his credentials and and background .
     [java] 
     [java] When will he be in a position to make a firm announcement about the placing of an order for the fourth Trident submarine ?
     [java] 
     [java] But these findings are also tied in with assertions about social class differences in domesticity which abound in much of the literature dealing with women 's place in the family .
     [java] 
     [java] Leapor makes general assertions about marriage in this poem partly because she can not make further particular observations without offending Octavia .
     [java] 
     [java] The assertion about the murder of the father setting problems for the unconscious life of all later generations has been left unexamined in anthropology and sociology .
     [java] 
     [java] In other words , let us avoid a priori assertions about human nature and try instead to perform a systematic explication of indigenous ideas concerning human nature and social and cosmological relationships .
     [java] 
     [java] People never bragged about their beginnings , only about what they had achieved , and never admitted it was through someone else 's sweat .
     [java] 
     [java] And certainly not Rod , who likes to brag about his off-the-job exploits at the meat factory where he works .
     [java] 
     [java] I know you 've been seeing my Josephine and I 've heard you brag about it , you cocky little bastard .
     [java] 
     [java] Mr Major bragged about his opt-out from the social chapter , saying that it would attract foreign investment from Britain 's neighbours .
     [java] 
     [java] Furthermore , `` there have been questions about his loyalty '' , for Alderson has had the temerity to caution the service about an apparent drift towards paramilitarism .
     [java] 
     [java] She constantly needed to caution him about the many dangers he was either too young or too stupid to recognize for himself .
     [java] 
     [java] He would later swear that he had cautioned me about this the previous night .
     [java] 
     [java] Physically demonstrate various ways of interacting socially with others , indicate how she might make positive comments about another child , and show her how to play constructively .
     [java] 
     [java] Soviet leaders have made no direct comment about events in Eastern Europe -- except to welcome reformist changes when they happen .
     [java] 
     [java] We add little comments about life outside work .
     [java] 
     [java] Writing in the Commons Diary in the Arbroath Herald in January , 1982 , the MP Peter Fraser commented about a meeting with Eva Burrows .
     [java] 
     [java] Complaints about noise have increased tenfold in the past fifteen years , and all the signs are that the problem is still getting worse .
     [java] 
     [java] The interest of Hodgson 's argument lay in two things : the pedigree he sketched for his contention about the greater economy and productivity of free labour and the comparative dimension historically and geographically of his argument .
     [java] 
     [java] Allegories of Reading ( 1979 ) , for example , is the place where de Man develops a critique of the referentiality of language in an argument which culminates regularly in his most cited declarations about the nature of language .
     [java] 
     [java] Griping about the boss , no doubt .
     [java] 
     [java] Soldiers wiped out a village in south Sumatra 's Lampung province in 1989 because a zealot was thought to be preaching fundamentalism ( it has emerged he was just griping about land ownership ) .
     [java] 
     [java] He led them at a smart pace along the path where the railway had been and though they grumbled about the branches scratching their legs his sister and his brothers followed him .
     [java] 
     [java] He grumbled incessantly about the `` disgusting '' provincial life we had to lead on the island .
     [java] 
     [java] Jane was a kindhearted and helpful Sixer , but Christine was inclined to grumble about Sarah .
     [java] 
     [java] For instance , in November 1990 two brothers in Abbotabad were each sentenced to six years ' imprisonment and given a heavy fine for having preached about their faith .
     [java] 
     [java] What John is doing in each situation is very much the same : he is making a pronouncement about something .
     [java] 
     [java] The colonial experience gave him material for his propositions about colonial nationalism , the subject which he quickly made his own .
     [java] 
     [java] Thank you for your generous remarks about my own work .
     [java] 
     [java] I fully agree with my hon. Friend 's remarks about pedestrians .
     [java] 
     [java] That was the date sensational revelations about her unhappy life with Charles were first published in Andrew Morton 's book Diana : Her True Story .
     [java] 
     [java] His resignation , and the subsequent revelations about his personal life , caused widespread shock in Ireland .
     [java] 
     [java] If he hoped for public sympathy from his revelations about the affair and marriage , he was very wrong .
     [java] 
     [java] She did n't like what he said about shades of grey , nor the suggestion that villains and heroes were artificial categories .
     [java] 
     [java] It suddenly occurred to Cissie that Beth had never spoken about her own parents .
     [java] 
     [java] When women write about misogyny , they do it from the standpoint of victims .
     [java] 
     [java] Joe was still careful to keep their meetings secret lest some kind friend wrote about them to Terry , but Maureen and Sarah 's father made the meetings easier for them .
     [java] 
     [java] Would you be so effusive about the indoctrination of Muslims at the State 's expense ?
     [java] 
     [java] And the Labour Party has been remarkably silent about this lack of trade union affiliation .
     [java] 
     [java] Anglo-Welsh have been conspicuously silent about their intentions with regard to the continued employment of our workforce .
     [java] 
     [java] The written sources are almost silent about the subject of internal trade , just as the details of overseas trade do not match the volume of archaeological evidence .
     [java] 
     [java] `` You will remain completely silent about this , Herr Schiller , '' said von Starnberg .
     [java] 
     [java] Richard 's fretting about dinner . ''
     [java] 
     [java] There was so much to achieve and I fretted endlessly about the work that was needed to co-ordinate it all .
     [java] 
     [java] So long as an account 's written down somewhere , no one 's going to fuss about the details .
     [java] 
     [java] Around the time you were fussing about your dress ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] Paula 's always fussing about her figure so she does n't go to Mr Roberts ' sweet shop , she buys tapes and magazines from the newsagent 's on the corner .
     [java] 
     [java] I do n't think we need worry ourselves about little Miss Harker . ''
     [java] 
     [java] We do not need to worry about Gioella di Grignano .
     [java] 
     [java] The family worried about it in their different ways .
     [java] 
     [java] My brothers would n't let me worry about money -- they 'd always see me all right . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` Do n't worry about Rose , '' he said .
     [java] 
     [java] No , I 'm really annoyed about this .
     [java] 
     [java] He looked annoyed about something .
     [java] 
     [java] But I did n't see it that way at all -- and I was very disappointed about the whole affair .
     [java] 
     [java] Fruit and vegetable growers in the area are furious about the decision .
     [java] 
     [java] No one was more pleased about Dara 's demise than Roshanara Begum .
     [java] 
     [java] She 's still sore about Dawn 's accusations when her dog died . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Markets have had a bad few weeks , but if the City gets upset about the outcome of the election , or the currency markets react strongly , there could be more pain in store .
     [java] 
     [java] As soon as children start to feel upset about food their appetite disappears and the process of eating becomes much more difficult .
     [java] 
     [java] `` What do you like about England ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] He loves everything about his new uniform .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I have loved many things about it , and certainly the Chamber .
     [java] 
     [java] What he had loved about Sylvie had always in part been his inability to pin her down , to capture her .
     [java] 
     [java] She was still quietly fuming about Felipe 's remarks as dinner drew near , however , and he had put her in a very awkward position .
     [java] 
     [java] Corbett repeated his instructions and , throwing his cloak about him , went downstairs .
     [java] 
     [java] Behind them a young man with a paint-flecked beard followed the designer about the set , twitching the hem of the velvet curtains hung at the window and rearranging the ornaments on the mantelpiece .
     [java] 
     [java] Depression now wrapped itself about her , making concentration difficult , while the thought of Silas holding Doreen in his arms brought a sudden flare of honesty that caused her to admit she was jealous .
     [java] 
     [java] At last she rose from the water , wrapping a towel about her damp body as she walked to her room , mentally weighed down by her thoughts , and physically wearied , too .
     [java] 
     [java] The dogs bounded about her , obstreperously wagging their tails .
     [java] 
     [java] The sun had shone so that , after their lemon meringue pie , they had come out here , where the long-haired cat danced about the lawn , and Gaily had noticed the back-gate swinging off its hinges .
     [java] 
     [java] Cornucopia : rabbits , hunched and private , loping slowly about the lawn in the moonlight ; a green frog , gleaming and sparkling in the dewy sunlit grass as it wiggled along some compelling migratory path ; squirrels -- quick flashes of ginger and grey in the treetops , a sudden glimpse of bright beady eyes ; a mythical fox -- dusky shadow and sinister snowprints .
     [java] 
     [java] He had lurched about a London drinking club soon after the Hiss case claiming `` I am the English Hiss ! ''
     [java] 
     [java] She paced about the sitting-room for a minute , then went to her mother 's chair and knelt on one knee on the floor beside her .
     [java] 
     [java] She undressed partly and padded about the perpetually shifting floor in stocking feet , suspenders , slip and bra .
     [java] 
     [java] Kimberley and Killion were prancing about the sky , failing to distract the defences , and Lambert strayed into a hail of machine-gun fire , splashed with flak .
     [java] 
     [java] He prowls about the place , you know , on his own , and dreams of springing a dazzling surprise on the archaeological world some day .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm not the slightest bit interested in you -- or what you wear ! '' she hissed at him beneath the sound of the children 's laughter as they jumped off the bed , and scampered about the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Observing his target through cold eyes , Mortimer strode ahead , pistol ready , marking the positions of the dark figures who could be made out scrambling about the building .
     [java] 
     [java] `` You can come and help me to carry some pictures , George dear , '' she said to young Curdle , who was skipping about the playground .
     [java] 
     [java] She took a few steps about the room , hoping the movement successfully concealed her dread .
     [java] 
     [java] Oliver grunted and strode about the paved veranda impatiently .
     [java] 
     [java] He spent a lot of time swaggering about the place , flexing his muscles and telling everyone what he was going to do with those `` foolish little feller-me-lads '' if they showed up .
     [java] 
     [java] Now Jacqueline , trotting about the shop telling herself some endless and only vaguely comprehensible story , knocked down a pile of brightly coloured buckets .
     [java] 
     [java] For an hour or two we trudged about trying to find something more ( or something at all ) to see , and even photograph .
     [java] 
     [java] Overladen buses trundle about the city , and a taxi fleet pensioned off in colonial days still plies its trade like a permanent veteran car rally .
     [java] 
     [java] You wander about the house like a soul in torment .
     [java] 
     [java] Ruth gazed about her in awe .
     [java] 
     [java] He stopped for a moment and gazed about him .
     [java] 
     [java] Cecil gazed about the office as if in search of inspiration .
     [java] 
     [java] He gazed despairingly about the room .
     [java] 
     [java] Karr looked about him at the carnage , then turned , facing Ebert .
     [java] 
     [java] Omally peered furtively about the bar and gestured the barman closer .
     [java] 
     [java] However , after this early burst of full-frontal militarism , Baden-Powell became decidedly shy about the matter .
     [java] 
     [java] Morse was usually reasonably tolerant about fellow-tipplers , and indeed occasionally rather enjoyed the company of slightly tipsy sirens ; but the sight of this fellow pathetically fighting to extricate a wallet from an inner pocket , and then forking out and handing over three $10 notes -- such a sight filled even Morse with mild disgust .
     [java] 
     [java] The DGM felt quite comfortable about this and also tolerant about the trusts ' sometimes misplaced attempts to establish their autonomy : '' After escaping from the nest they go around flapping their wings and hissing at people '' .
     [java] 
     [java] After further confrontation about the car , it was agreed that S would leave the vehicle outside her home to be collected by another member of staff while she was away .
     [java] 
     [java] But in reality it was a compromise designed to bring the long factional struggle about Pilger 's role to an end .
     [java] 
     [java] Another appointee might have seen the ideological struggle about money for the arts as politics-as-usual .
     [java] 
     [java] We 've been fighting about money of late , but then again it might be my face .
     [java] 
     [java] Schneider draped a sheet about his shoulders and reached for a pair of scissors .
     [java] 
     [java] Then he dropped her hand , and swept her back into his arms , nestling his face in the glowing tresses about her head .
     [java] 
     [java] One prominent German academic proposed recently that , in reorganising higher education after German unification , former East Germans should `` forget about the arts '' .
     [java] 
     [java] As Hunt saw the situation on that first Sunday in a new team , he could not be certain about his own capabilities .
     [java] 
     [java] However , he is n't uncertain about his role .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm not sure about education for girls . ''
     [java] 
     [java] There was an air of tremendous confidence about him .
     [java] 
     [java] She is dubious about the mass appropriation of hip hop style in fashion , believing that many stylists are `` cashing in '' .
     [java] 
     [java] Baldwin was one party man who remained a convinced Christian but without certainty about forms , and he was also characteristic of one sort of party response to the suffering caused by the war itself .
     [java] 
     [java] Or had he felt a calming certainty about the need for self-preservation which had overcome all apprehension and a lifetime of Sunday School morality -- just as Urquhart felt now ?
     [java] 
     [java] After this , we might fairly expect our journey to have led us to some certainties about the language .
     [java] 
     [java] There are people who know that they have experienced deep within themselves a reality which gives them simple and overwhelming certainties about the real goals of human existence and which transforms their lives .
     [java] 
     [java] The two are said to be doubtful about Sun 's ability to deliver the code on time and they suspect the company may not give their systems priority over its own .
     [java] 
     [java] Mrs Rose was doubtful about scallops .
     [java] 
     [java] Later confiding that she was surprised that Kiefer turned up at all that day , the same press officer admits she was doubtful about the interview from the off .
     [java] 
     [java] However , there is a different form of uncertainty that can not possibly help the theist 's case , and that is uncertainty about what is meant by talking about God .
     [java] 
     [java] Uncertainty about the future and lack of continuity of decisions make it hard for the substitute parents to make a strong commitment to the child and include the natural parent .
     [java] 
     [java] A comparable uncertainty about the conventional wisdom of past decades can be found among political scientists concerning the forces shaping the state and influencing its responses both to the market and to civil society .
     [java] 
     [java] However , our uncertainty about the present average density of the universe is even greater .
     [java] 
     [java] The films was advertised as the BANNED film because of Churchill 's doubts about its message , but no serious attempt was made to stop it being made or shown .
     [java] 
     [java] But the new President , in spite of his doubts about Soviet motives , did not rush towards a showdown with Stalin .
     [java] 
     [java] We began a series of recriminations about the events leading up to the war .
     [java] 
     [java] Almost by reflex , McIlvanney and I take a corner table , and open up on the safe territory of swapping recriminations about our country 's lack of respect for the trade .
     [java] 
     [java] Michael Steen , owner of Wessex Home Care and a Dorset councillor , said more than 20 would-be providers had contacted him about licences .
     [java] 
     [java] Firstly , my sincere apologies for not having contacted you earlier about your proposal .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm phoning about our dinner on the twelfth of November ; I want to discuss the seating arrangements .
     [java] 
     [java] And when they rang me about the killing and somebody said , `` your friend 's been murdered , '' I said , `` You 're talking rubbish . '' ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` Last year I had dozens of calls about injured hedgehogs , '' she says .
     [java] 
     [java] Her kindness touched me , but I knew that soon she would hear the lies about me , and then she would hate me !
     [java] 
     [java] And he did n't deceive himself about the nature of her hold on him .
     [java] 
     [java] I thought he and you , both of you , had deceived me about your relationship -- the way Suzanna and Raich deceived me for a time .
     [java] 
     [java] In a biography about the godly E.B. Pusey , one of the Tractarians of the last century , this is written :
     [java] 
     [java] In a biography about the former England captain about to be published , the rift which existed between the pair for the final 15 months of Lineker 's international career is at last revealed .
     [java] 
     [java] Gemini Productions will present J B Keane 's `` The Matchmaker '' at the end of September -- the Irish comedy about a man who helps those in search of the perfect partner .
     [java] 
     [java] A final caution about using monographs about painters is that they can seldom be read alone .
     [java] 
     [java] Lodge was recently amused by the arrival from America of the first critical monograph about him .
     [java] 
     [java] But if you are looking for an energetic , pacy saga about medical scientists on the hunt for the cause of a mysterious and horrendously lethal infection , forget about Foreman , Peters and the hordes of novelists who continue to exploit that particular lode .
     [java] 
     [java] He had bought a second-hand paperback about nineteenth-century English railway navvies .
     [java] 
     [java] Strangely , that modesty did not extend to sparing the Royal Family 's blushes over the serialization of Andrew Morton 's book about Princess Di and her marriage .
     [java] 
     [java] America 's computer buffs spent $110m last year buying magazines about their machines , and computer makers another $670m advertising in them .
     [java] 
     [java] I once worked on a magazine about the law , called , imaginatively , Law Magazine .
     [java] 
     [java] They should have a sermon about Rome when he got back .
     [java] 
     [java] A German gerontologist , in an article about old people written for GPs , wittily attacks stereotypes with facts , cartoons and photographs .
     [java] 
     [java] It contains and excellent article about Pat Keen and her classes , a splendid photo of Pat herself and the observation -- accurate indeed -- that she looked years younger than her age .
     [java] 
     [java] The woman who answered Bernadette 's ad for a childminder gave a false name , no proper address , was evasive about her phone number , and had no references .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Elek is a very Persuasive and charming Central European -- or is he Hungarian ? -- and easy to work with , '' Minton told her , `` except he 's rather evasive about the money . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Madonna attributes her openness about her own life , her honesty about sex and her apparent ability to handle her personal problems to psychiatry .
     [java] 
     [java] But the most famous of such treatises about the Jews were written in the middle of the second century .
     [java] 
     [java] The disclosure about their son 's positive test result was made at 2 to 3 weeks .
     [java] 
     [java] And when Adam announced that he was leaving the army , Lawrence asked for no explanation and could n't have been kinder about his unemployment problem .
     [java] 
     [java] Well , one thing 's for sure -- if people are rude about her , she makes sure she gives as good as she gets .
     [java] 
     [java] I am being polite about the way in which the Government have behaved when I say that they have dealt with our recommendations in a cavalier fashion .
     [java] 
     [java] We might at least be fair about the ways in which we account for pupils ' behaviour .
     [java] 
     [java] I 'm being nice about it .
     [java] 
     [java] He was pleasant about it , I 'll give him that .
     [java] 
     [java] He often raises that subject , and we understand his desperation about what will happen to his seat at the next election .
     [java] 
     [java] Jane felt little regret about that .
     [java] 
     [java] The society is worried about traditional Victorian front doors being replaced with unsuitable off-the-peg doors .
     [java] 
     [java] `` You 're worried about your wife ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] Is he nervous about the critical reaction to his first work of fiction ?
     [java] 
     [java] He was embarrassed about the nature of his illness and reluctant to discuss his bowel function with anyone , especially young women .
     [java] 
     [java] `` But the council 's so embarrassed about that one that they 're just leaving them to put it right as quietly as they can .
     [java] 
     [java] Richmond councillors are worried about plans to turn the old cinema on the Ryders Wynd/Queens Road junction into a DIY shop .
     [java] 
     [java] Some of the marchers were apprehensive about this very hi-tech physiotherapy department .
     [java] 
     [java] They may not be unduly apprehensive about climate change , but they know about the greenhouse effect and how the state of the world and their own localities impinges on their lives .
     [java] 
     [java] She missed him , and missed the companionable secrecy of their relationship , but she was not miserable about it .
     [java] 
     [java] As Michael Codron told me : `` Ken remained very loyal to it , even though he was miserable about it .
     [java] 
     [java] Senator Sherman had shot marginally less well than his son and was openly disgruntled about this .
     [java] 
     [java] Nevertheless , even among non-abolitionists ( and across most of the political spectrum ) there has been grave disquiet about the state of the prisons .
     [java] 
     [java] Disappointment about the French government 's budget knocked 2.6% off share prices in Paris during the week .
     [java] 
     [java] Thereupon he made the surprising comment that the agitation about his List was inspired by anti-Semitism .
     [java] 
     [java] I remembered his amusement about such underwear on his first evening at Sleet , how he subsided into laughter , infectious to everyone but me .
     [java] 
     [java] There was no excitement about my first bra -- I even had to pay , because my mum claimed I did n't need one !
     [java] 
     [java] `` Our reserve team manager Brian Sparrow is amazed at the accusations about damage to property .
     [java] 
     [java] It denied denying what it called groundless accusations about embassy involvement in the attack .
     [java] 
     [java] Indeed , the author of the work was so outraged by the Government 's claims about what was said in the work that he wrote to the Evening Standard on 1 October and said : '' We found much to criticise about the British arrangement for training young people .
     [java] 
     [java] Many doctors are very scathing about anti-cellulite creams but the secret is not to expect too much of them .
     [java] 
     [java] Besides , you 're in no position to lecture me about marriage . ''
     [java] 
     [java] No matter how long the lance master lectured him about truth to oneself , inner nobility and purity , the words seemed hollow in the light of his first remarks .
     [java] 
     [java] The repeal movement 's national leadership , alarmed about Hopkins ' activities , wrote warning her against any collusion with the enemy . ''
     [java] 
     [java] In 1986 the local authority became concerned about injuries which D had sustained and they obtained a place of safety order .
     [java] 
     [java] `` I 'm delighted about that .
     [java] 
     [java] Records must not be based on the measurement of subjective impressions such as the number of times parents felt depressed about their child 's behaviour .
     [java] 
     [java] When Lansdowne communicated his despair about the war to the press in 1917 and called for negotiations , there was a storm of protest .
     [java] 
     [java] They quarrelled about art .
     [java] 
     [java] Though economists quarrel about the causes of the 1930s depression as inconclusively as they do about everything else , certain basic features are not in doubt .
     [java] 
     [java] He and Maltote quarrelled about what was genuine fur , and what the jewelled embroidered motifs and the bright hues on the cloaks of some retainers really signified .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Let 's not fight about a few hours . ''
     [java] 
     [java] Are we to fight about it ? ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` It is n't carved in stone that we have to fight about this , '' she protested , wanting their meeting to end on a genial note , but mainly wanting it to end .
     [java] 
     [java] An extremely public row about the denial of tenure to a young lecturer associated with the progressive party opened old wounds and inflicted new ones on this always thin-skinned community .
     [java] 
     [java] As a close friend commented : `` They had shocking rows about her , real stinkers and I do n't blame Diana one bit . ''
     [java] 
     [java] You may end up in the red , but as long as it 's not by too much , you 're less likely to have rows about it . ''
     [java] 
     [java] And if she had n't brought those stupid letters , if they had n't had a row about them , it could have been fun working with him .
     [java] 
     [java] At a deeper level , they rowed about greed -- guilt about greed and protection from supposedly greedy women .
     [java] 
     [java] We 'd rowed about it endlessly , but I was quite determined .
     [java] 
     [java] It got rather nasty -- at one point my sister and I were actually playing tug-of-war with a vase -- and ended with us rowing about which of us was his favourite .
     [java] 
     [java] They are said to squabble endlessly about personnel appointments and propaganda slogans .
     [java] 
     [java] But as soon as I begin to be nice to him , a sort of self-satisfaction seems to creep into his voice and his manner ( very discreet , he 's been humility itself all day , no reproach about last night , of course ) and I begin to want to goad and slap him again .
     [java] 
     [java] Racing and Ireland go together -- it is said there are as many horses as people ( three and a half million ) -- and racecourse crowds are extremely knowledgeable about the sport .
     [java] 
     [java] The Queen has a large farm at Windsor , which the Duke of Edinburgh manages , and another at Sandringham ; and she herself is very knowledgeable about livestock and pedigrees , as is the Queen Mother .
     [java] 
     [java] There is ample evidence that in the Victorian and Edwardian ages working-class women were knowledgeable about techniques by which they could control family size .
     [java] 
     [java] Maltravers decided not to tell Stephen about the inscription in the Le Carre book .
     [java] 
     [java] Scathach had been telling about his first journey through the wood .
     [java] 
     [java] `` Your father is so proud of you , there 's hardly a customer that he has n't told about your great success . ''
     [java] 
     [java] The Daniel and Hamnett shootings had been competently executed , his pride in the latter however slightly dented by recollection of the stupid lie he had told about his wife .
     [java] 
     [java] The farming industry needs to inform the public about all aspects of their industry and open these up to public discussion .
     [java] 
     [java] The police did n't inform the British Consulate about Jeremy 's disappearance until October 30 , and it was n't until the next day that the consulate contacted Jeremy 's grandmother in England .
     [java] 
     [java] Every exhibition should be treated as an opportunity to inform visitors about our scientific activities and priorities .
     [java] 
     [java] Some of the children 's expectations were so heartbreakingly wrong that it was clear that much more needed to be done to inform young people about what work is really like .
     [java] 
     [java] Pry now asks you to advise him about a house he wants to buy .
     [java] 
     [java] The hostel staff advised us about the best areas for walking , and also arranged for the essential guide , to keep us on the right path and to protect us from the buffalo .
     [java] 
     [java] The nurse also notified the physiotherapist about Mr Brown 's problems ( see also Chapters 5 and 8 ) .
     [java] 
     [java] The House will welcome the Minister 's assurance about the protection of people when they are in custody , but unfortunately the Minister 's perception is completely different from that of the community as a whole .
     [java] 
     [java] Animal welfare had been the subject of discussions with several leading UK retailers and the Danish industry had offered assurances about the way in which animals are produced and reared there .
     [java] 
     [java] One of his ideas was to travel to different churches and town halls , providing all entertainment and giving an address about deafness .
     [java] 
     [java] Tolkien could have given a lecture about all these at any time .
     [java] 
     [java] In fact it became standing room only as Mr Duncan Broady , curator of the Greater Manchester Police Museum , gave a fascinating lecture about crime in the period , particularly as it affected Manchester and Salford .
     [java] 
     [java] The three of us would chat about anything and everything for a while then Alan would take him into the surgery so that they could be private . ''
     [java] 
     [java] `` He could n't hold a conversation about anything else .
     [java] 
     [java] Basically what I like to do is have a conversation about the project and then get the designer to come up with an answer .
     [java] 
     [java] I was no closer to knowing the selection procedure , as my conversations about this with the other recruits had been based on mere speculation and gossip .
     [java] 
     [java] `` We congregated at certain bookshops and talked a lot about books .
     [java] 
     [java] Then I administered a little ouzo and we began to talk about Ivy .
     [java] 
     [java] `` They let me in on the secret quite early -- then people started joking about it .
     [java] 
     [java] `` People making jokes about poppadam crumbs ?
     [java] 
     [java] During the latter part of 1988 , the music papers were full of gossip about the band joining forces with a major label .
     [java] 
     [java] And if she had heard nothing of the gossip about his private life before she accepted him , certain ladies he had discarded , both married and single , took care that she overheard quite a lot now .
