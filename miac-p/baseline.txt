     [java] Baldwin was one party man who remained a convinced Christian but without certainty about forms , and he was also characteristic of one sort of party response to the suffering caused by the war itself .
     [java] Or had he felt a calming certainty about the need for self-preservation which had overcome all apprehension and a lifetime of Sunday School morality -- just as Urquhart felt now ?
     [java] After this , we might fairly expect our journey to have led us to some certainties about the language .
